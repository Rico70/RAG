3yiHZWr6Izc,A Complete Marketing Strategy In 3 Minutes,Unknown,166839,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3yiHZWr6Izc/hq720.jpg,2023-04-22 00:00:00,191,GaryVee,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yiHZWr6Izc,the framework for me doing social brand building and building businesses is what's the brand stand for what's the business objective the next thing we do is we create 40 to 50 consumer segmentations not three right 40 to 50 consumer segmentations 18 to 22 year old males limbing in Bangladesh that are into Esports 21 to 27 year old females in Tokyo making 200 000 a year 40 to 45 year old moms in Malaysia who have an affinity towards High fashion real specific consumer cohorts with real teeth okay next on that is called pack platforms and culture like do you actually understand what the platforms are doing next which platforms are you creating for you've now gone the whole way down now it's we're going to pick Instagram and Facebook and Twitter and for me every brand that's in this room should be on all of them but this is back to allocation more to their dollars go so they can't but they should but they'd rather spend eight million dollars on a TV spot so you lay out the platforms then you go to work so now you create a framework now your creative and strategy team are ready to work now you start posting against framework right you know what consumer you're going after you know what you're trying to achieve in business you know how the platforms work so you know Facebook reels is underpriced right now you know that green screen headline creative is over indexing on Tick Tock you know so you start making now the work really begins after you make you have a person your strategy team called the PCS a post creative strategist her and his job is to look at all the qualitative feedback you have your analytics and media team look at the Quant feedback and you start making your machine smart like a half pregnant AI the team gets smart through the work you start looking at the proxies when you've got a retail brand that sells in retail stores you're running the media against hold out clusters to prove that you're actually driving incremental growth if you have a DTC brand or an app it's a piece of cake you're just looking at the black and white data when the creative goes viral or over indexes its Norm it becomes the brief for more efficient and effective work so now the virality based on the consumer sentiment and intent and truth becomes a proxy to your brief not a strategist sitting in an office going on Reddit for four hours writing a brief then you do that forever and ever and ever your cohorts are an accordion as you start getting affirmation that something's not working you actually eliminate Malaysian moms 40 45 because you aren't finding Affinity your creative team hasn't hit the mark on the flip side while marketing to Indonesia Gamers 13 to 15 you realize it's actually the female Gamers 13 to 15 that are even more interested in the intent and you create a new cohort to go there to double down on the truth of the consumer not the audacity of the board group thank you [Music]
91D5hjMEADg,55 Minutes of Social Media Content Strategy for Entrepreneurs,Unknown,777650,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/91D5hjMEADg/hq720.jpg,2022-12-08 00:00:00,3257,Think Media,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91D5hjMEADg,there's an unspoken question in every person's mind that has to First be answered why should I listen to you and I think it influences how people share how people take your content everything it's the frame that the content is consumed in you have to do things so that you have evidence that you can support why you are good and so I think it's really speaking on your truths rather than claiming to know the truth hey here's what I did versus here's what you should do feel the difference I broke it into three sections to make more sense so section one is why did I do this to begin with two what and how and how much like what do we do to actually create that and then third is observations so quick backstory I'm gonna go through this as fast as possible this is me when I started my business career sleep on the floor I signed my first lease slept on that floor for the first nine months was able to uh get it to that picture on the left in a year then I open a new location every six months after that and then over the next 18 months I met Layla and we did Jim turn around so we basically fly from place to place to place and fill gyms up but it was a Hands-On sales model I had at our Peak eight sales guy turn around eight gyms every month that became tenuous logistically and we're like I wonder if there's a better way and so from there we packaged our IP for a better gym model into a licensing business and so we were able to grow gym launch which was a B2B business to two and a half million bucks a month prestigious to 1.7 a month which was B to B to C that was an affiliate based business and it was weight loss and supplements so e-commerce we scaled Allen to 1.6 million a month which was B to B to C and we just recently sold that for 46.2 and we just sold that one last year as well which I'm not allowed to say the number but there you go then we started acquisition.com which right now does about 13 million a month so right now we grow three million plus Internet businesses into 30 million plus sellable businesses that's kind of what we do now and so hopefully you're probably asking this question which is like what does this have to do with growing video or growing with video objection [Applause] um but I started making video content with three goals so number one was to attract uh internet business owners doing three million or more who align with our values uh number two is to help all businesses blow our minimum deal size to just grow to the deal size that was kind of the idea like how do I just get everybody who's at a million to three million or 100K to 3 million whatever just get everybody up above that level so we can hopefully work with them um and then three to create a place where I could document and share the best practices of building world-class companies from my experience and like we're not the Elon musks and the besos and and all that but I wish that those guys had documented what they had done like how cool would it have been to see like the Vlog of Amazon in 1996 right how sick would that have been and like every day is like yep almost lost the company today like six months later almost lost the company again I thought that would have been awesome so I thought you know I didn't I did a really poor job of documenting everything up to this point so I was really committed to like all right for this next phase um I really want to do a better job of it so that's the idea lo and behold business is doing three million dollars or more um started reaching out to us which was awesome right success so I guess this might have something to do with video uh but believe me when I say that no one is surprised as me about this kind of organic stuff in general because I've never done it before so we're on this ride together all right so here's the goal for the presentation give you a few lessons that I've learned to take you from wherever you are do a little closer to wherever you want to go with this presentation I'm so good at content there's the little myth okay great so disclaimer again never done this I also didn't want to be famous or known for a very long time there's me saying I want to be rich not famous but several experiences changed my mind so I'll walk you through this really quickly so when Kylie do you remember this one Kylie was announced that she was a billionaire well that's what I felt like that day um it's like what am I doing wrong and then the rock you know killing it and then boom he's got a two billion dollar plus uh tequila brand that he was able to launch off his organic audience Conor McGregor 600 million with proper 12 was probably grown by since now Huda now is a billion dollar brand and so I can be a little slow sometimes but I could kind of read the writing on the wall uh so there's the writing on the wall uh but I didn't want to build an e-commerce brand because all those were e-commerce physical products Brands and I was like ah it's not my vibe I already did that once it's not like it's not my favorite of the businesses that we've done so I still kind of like drag my feet a little bit and that's when I heard this guy Nomad capitalist who like teaches people to not be U.S citizens that's not the point but um so you can not pay taxes but anyways um that's when I heard of podcast with this guy and he was like oh yeah I get about 3 000 applications a month I was like holy cannoli I was like well if I had 3 000 applications a month I would make at least one dollar if that were my life and so I realized it could work for B2B not just e-commerce stuff I was like that's neat and then I heard Neil Patel was doing 100 million bucks a year doing a B2B agency Services all off inbound I was like okay this might make sense and so again I still was like all right so it does work for B2B organic stuff works but I still didn't really want to be famous that was not my vibe and so I met up with dear friends of ours Lisa and Dean graciosi and we had a conversation that was kind of last straw here so I was like dude being famous sounds terrible he was just telling us about how like somebody like showed up his house and threatened his kids and I was like that sounds awful like why no no thank you I'm good I'll just pass on grass and so he's like if getting harassed and attacked is the price I have to pay for the it would say it's supposed to say impact that was perfect um for the impact that I want to have then I'd pay that price every time which totally takes away from the impact of that message um but I was like he's right you know what I mean like he said if if if that's the price I have to pay to make the impact I want to have and I pay that price every time I was like all right I need to I need to stop being here all right so 18 months ago I started a YouTube channel some of you guys may have anybody seen this the YouTube channel [Music] nosy Nation and so I built two expensive Studios to launch this thing um I started making three videos a week uh side note important lesson that I learned on a vacation uh that really one did better than my really fancy one which then taught me that what's inside the content matters more than the wrapper So for anybody who's like worried about getting started about making it look right I don't think it matters I mean I think it matters a little bit but it's 80 20. so focus on the 80. all right and so I continued my very steady growth for for that period of time which is great recommend um but you know the first 12 months we went from 600 to 70 000 to travel which was cool and so things were going smoothly until one day I had to chat with Grant Cardone about branding and it reminded me that all the lessons that I learned in business applied to all this organic stuff and so I was on this call with him and I have the full video on my YouTube channel if you want to check it out um yeah he was like bro I'm not even gonna try he was like bro pull up your Instagram I was like okay he's like pull up my Instagram he's like I got 10 times the content is you 10 times he's like bro it's volume bro volume and um I was like that's deep um and so I was like you know I should probably do more uh which is a lesson that I have learned over and over and over again in business and I'll tell you a couple more story about later uh but like so many times we're doing the right stuff we're just doing way way too little of it like I'll tell you a quick story which is not on this presentation but when I started my first gym I was told that I should put flyers out and so I went uh you know I'm like really you know full of piss and vinegar I'm gonna go do it so the business owner told me had was more successful than me Etc and so I went I put the Flyers out and then like nothing really happened so I met back up with him a few weeks later and he was like hey how'd the Flyers work and I was like uh you know I got one guy who called me and said I picked up his car um that was it he's like what was your test size I was like hmm uh I was like well I mean I I put 300 out and he was like dude our test size 5 000. he's like that's what we test with he's like and then we do 5000 a day oh noted and so it was just a really good lesson and that happens with phone calls like yeah I'm doing I'm gonna I'm gonna start doing cold calls you make 10 calls every three days when you're feeling motivated rather than doing 200 dials every day like it's Clockwork before lunch you know what I mean the level of effort difference is not like 2X or 4X it's like 50x it's a lot bigger and most people dramatically underestimate the amount of volume and effort that is required to get to where you want to go like dramatically and so those I've so many lessons that this repeated and I was taught yet again in a different sphere that I'm not familiar with that this was true I'm also wearing the same shirt uh so I decided to take his advice and dramatically increase the amount of content that we created and how many places we displayed it right and so before I tell you um who wants to guess how many pieces of content we started putting out weekly after that call 25. 10 000 less than that I would be so much more famous if I put 10 000 out what was that a hundred good good guess so we went from seven pieces of content we got it three on YouTube and I just repurposed the same three on a podcast um to 80 80 content pieces a week and for scale if you remember the first line that I showed you way before the top of that is that purple line from the first graph I showed you and so pretty pretty cool and so this is what happened in those six months we added 300 000 subscribers on YouTube seven thousand followers on Instagram still haven't really cracked that one uh 350 000 on Tick Tock 150 000 buyers which is cool uh on Amazon for the book uh 350 000 followers on Instagram 100 000 on uh Twitter and 400 000 downloads a month on the podcast cool right so basically 100 a million person audience uh within that six months and because I'm more of a business guy than I am a quote influencer Creator uh this is what I cared about so the net traffic result for us as web traffic went from basically non-existent to about a hundred thousand uh unique clicks a month to the site just organically pretty cool uh number two is the subscriber so I told you before and then this is one that's really cool for who here runs paid ads can I get a okay some of you cool so this this will resonate with you so in the businesses that I had at a 25 CPM we were getting two million dollars a month in exposure free not only not free we're getting paid to do it crazy like I'm I'm beside myself still because I think it's insane so the fact that this opportunity exists right now is literal Insanity to me like we're getting paid now to Market like what a world right and so the business result from that is that we get about 400 companies a month that apply for acquisition.com uh so we can help them scale um and in that time period We Grew From 7 million a month to 13 million a month um and disclaimer on that is that part of that was just the the companies themselves grew it wasn't like new companies um but still a lot in six months and so if you're anything like me you're probably thinking well that's really great for you Alex but what about me which is why I made section two which is how and how much all right so here's where you come in all right so let's start with how much so just a reminder here in terms of time I'm not like a Creator full-time so it's like 93 7 is probably the amount of time that I allocate towards this and so money wise this costs me 20 000 a month to do all right you can scale this down however you want I also don't have a tremendous amount of time that I allocate towards it so I have to compensate with that with money you could probably do this on your own I just I this is how I do it so we have a Twitter editor a YouTube editor a LinkedIn editor a podcast editor and an IGN Tick Tock editor all right um and there's two of us so times two so it's actually forty thousand a month for the both of us okay the amount of time that it takes me is two days uh per month and four hours per week uh and that is that is what I dedicate towards this and so quick recap I have a daily mind dump which I'll show you how I do it in a second because we're going to show you I'm going to show you the whole model I do a weekly Twitter review it takes me like four hours because Twitter is actually really important how I do all this stuff which I'll explain later and if you guys aren't on Twitter I actually it's my favorite platform but um we do one day a month of recording and then uh for shorts and then one day a month uh it's usually like a half day I'll do like four to eight YouTube videos the ones that are direct to camera and that's it that's the that's the jam so that's the how much that's what that's my investment that's my cost to do this and so here's the how and so this is the content creation model all right that's the big Visual and those are the Bold bullets fantastic let's start with the first one so test cord and Jet contextualized distribute so the old way that I used to do content was I would just have this ongoing email thread to myself I know you guys have like notes or like a chain to yourself because you probably get ideas you're in a conversation oh I should make a piece of content on that right and then you email it to yourself and that's how I did it for a long time and the new way is the Twitter web which is uh being blocked by the thing is a formatted word but uh I post all of those ideas as tweets on Twitter rather than just sending them to myself and so all of a sudden what used to be my inbox is actually just my like tweet thread all right and so I tweet about five times a day ish and the nice thing is that Twitter is a very forgiving platform so it's just like stream of Consciousness and it takes notes you don't have to pick vid you know videos or captions or I like it because it's just thoughts like that's I love Twitter so much for that reason and so I'll post this stuff and I'll be like okay those are the ones that people thought were interesting and then the threads become long format and the shorts become short format or the tweets become short format pretty simple step one everyone following with me so long my man and we feel like they could do that all right doable second step is recording right why am I doing both I realize that because you're like why you do short stuff um I was kind of against shorts and then I realized that I've never actually consumed anything from garyvee that's long but I like garyvee a lot I was like ah well I guess that worked so that's why I do both uh right and so I think it's a width and depth thing I think the shorts give you a lot of breath I think the Longs give you a lot of depth right and so there's a visual that I put together that took me too long to say that same thing great so this is everything that I know about about how to make content that quote goes viral I watched a long like interview with Mr Beast my big practice of trying to learn stuff is go to the person who's the best at it and listen to them because they've already reorganized the information for you hack um and so he's like listen all these guys make this all compliment with their tags and hashtags and if any of you guys saw that this is not me offending you I have no idea what I'm talking about remember big grain assault um but he said it's just CTR times watch time that's it you got to get people to click you got to get people to watch I was like okay that makes sense he's like and that's what YouTube wants they want people to be interested in the content to get the click and then make sure that the content fulfills the promise of the thumbnail cool I was like I can do that and so this is the general format that I've used for the Longs which is like a hooker a question that I'm answering usually a story that's relevant to answer the question a framework that I've applied to repeat that process and then an explanation of why I think it works that's it and if I want to make longer stuff it's just that process with multiple stories repeating that over and over again the shorts is a hooker question a hammer which for me is my tweet I put the Tweet as the next thing I say because I already know it converts and then I have an example and an explanation that's about it that's Alex's million dollar thing there we go fantastic and so this is an example so it was like 28 ways to guarantee poverty or 28 ways to stay poor right so I made this thread got a lot of shares cool 28 rules reprogrammed my to be rich in 22 minutes so I have to change the the you know the headline and stuff but the content was identical I just did it in a video right and then the short ones that do well it's like all right overheard from an ABC oh blah blah authenticity is just a fancy word boom I just make a short version of the same thing just saying the tweet this makes sense okay cool and then I upload it fancy so far all right ta-da next one is inject so uh we grew the the podcast actually recently from like 20 000 a month to 400 000 a month and a big part of that was just having call to actions um sounds really dumb but I wasn't doing it so do it and so the way that we did it was we recorded two versions of each of the call to actions so like call to actions to other channels leadmatics share a tag if you have a lower ticket product I don't but like are you you know for me I just have a book it's not even a sense um you know leave a review uh if you want to ask for clients or you know send a question or there's my book their grandson offer so I would just record two different ctas for that and then I just inject them into the content so this is what it might look like so it's like you have your CTA One content mid-roll content uh end off does that make sense so we started doing that with the podcast and it started to grow a lot and now we're actually doing it in the rest of the forms of content so you'll see that from me uh because this has been working uh so this is me doing this walking the talk all right the point directions Etc okay contextualize so anyone seen this one before everyone see this like me that went viral so it's like everybody kind of appears somewhat differently even though it's the same person depending on the setting that you're in right on Facebook you look a certain way LinkedIn you look a certain way Tinder you look a certain way um I had a sales guy who uh was on this is not relevant at all um was on Tinder and uh and he would close every one of his dates uh on buying our supplements um so that he could get he was like it always covered dinner um Savage anyways um just you know Shooters got to shoot Okay so so you have to make the stuff contextual and so this is what we do so this is the same video right it's that same uh Navy SEAL video I made earlier right so that's a real that's a tick tock and then that's the YouTube short so it's the same thing you just you just make it match the platform same way you would make your Facebook look different than your Instagram look different than your LinkedIn Etc as long as you just make it contextual I think it it does a lot better because have you guys seen people just like take literally the exact same thing and post it on the wrong platform I just think it just hurts it and it's just not that much effort to make it contextual all right last one distribute then we distribute them all right so we went from seven times a week to 80 times a week in distribution that was the result over that six month period which is a lot of growth awesome and so we 10x the inputs and we got 10x the output surprising right so who here would like 10 times the output well then you can just 10x the input all right good talk um so quick recap all right content creation model test first thing you do make your brain dump into something that's actually generating content so this this is net zero time for me I was doing it and I just started doing it publicly number two is that once I have the stuff that's winning I record it I record the threads as long as I record the tweets of shorts from there the team injects the call to action so that I can direct the traffic whatever way I want to direct it right four and big one on this last injection thing like if you don't do this because I wasn't it you you get all of these Impressions and like eyeballs and stuff and you'll get followers but like you don't drive a result which again sounds silly that I wasn't doing this but I told you at the beginning you guys are better than I am at this number four was contextualize it I just think it works a lot better and then finally you cut it and increase the volume cool that makes sense so far great fantastic so was that helpful okay cool so that concludes section two how much and how fantastic observations I was going to call it musings but then I thought no one would know what that meant so um I just gave you the like traditional lip service on a Content generation model it's kind of boring and I don't think it's that interesting which is why I tried to get through it quickly because a lot of people ascribe that as the reason that we grew a lot and I don't think that's why but I'm presenting it because I would end up getting a zillion questions about it and so that's why it's there well I hope you are enjoying today's session and I wanted to let you know that if you are loving content like this then you definitely need to go to 21videotips.com where you can actually get 21 more video marketing tips just like this from industry experts like Patrick Bet David Vanessa Lau Pat

reason that we were able to grow so I'm going to put like my real hat on for a minute um is that and again this is my two cents there you go is that there's an unspoken question in every person's mind that has to First be answered which is why should I listen to you and I think it's one of the most profound questions and I think it influences how people share how people take your content everything it's the frame that the content is consumed in so I'll give you a real world example imagine you're talking to a guy you don't know anything he's just like talking about business and you're like oh that's cool and then like two seconds later it's like dude that guy's a billionaire all of a sudden you're like right the frame matters a lot Elon Musk makes a tweet that's like I'm on the toilet and it gets like 500 million shares right this guy's hilarious right it's because it's Elon right and he has a brand that he's established and there's context there and so I think that we should have this question answered for ourselves and our prospects before creating content all right and so imagine for a moment that I had done this whole presentation up to this point and I had a 1 000 person total audience between all of those platforms same presentation how different would that feel right just imagine do it on stage you don't know me and I have a thousand people on Instagram and that's it same presentation you would receive it differently right right I would because I would think it was stupid pointless preachy better than now full and if you're so good why don't you do it that's what I would think right and so we have to answer the question why should I listen to you and I think a lot of you are making content from a weak frame and that's just what I see that's just me witnessing it like you know it's like the 18 year old relationship coaches you know what I mean they're they're real you know like they're out there some of you are here right you know or it's like the business coaches that are doing five thousand dollars a month I don't you know I mean I don't have a lot like you know so besides all the stuff that we shared earlier the real reason that I think our audience is growing is that we're talking about stuff that we have evidence to support like that's the real right so all that I said earlier sure you can do that that worked for me you might not like Twitter I like Twitter because it's easy for me it's not easy for you don't do it right which is why this worked for me this time right that's the context but I think this stuff is the more kind of Eternal stuff and that's why I was kind of like excited to get to part three uh yes and so I think it's about having the evidence for your others and most importantly for yourself right we built these other companies first before ever talking about how to build companies right and so if you're like great Alex nice for you so how do I make content from just starting out excellent question so there's two frame shifts that I think have to occur do then talk how I versus how to and give versus get all right so let's start with the first one so who here hates this right um how to live an amazingly happy life and get everything that you want from somebody who is doing this part-time and is still cutting hair right there's nothing wrong with cutting hair but it probably wouldn't make you an authority on this matter does that make sense some of you are doing this and wondering why it's not working like I mean my stuff's so much better it honestly doesn't matter it doesn't matter because if I had a thousand people on state like on my followers and I made the same presentation you wouldn't give it like I'm trying like real right and so there's a better way I think all right so this is Alex's crazy content creation model trademark pending all right step one douche step two talk about what you just did I know and then do bigger this is a complex model I know we're getting to it so here's how it looks in the real world all right hey here's what I did versus here's what you should do feel the difference this is what I did if it works for you awesome if it doesn't work for you notice what here's 20 of my clients this is the stuff that I'm doing with them right now Rosie was struggling with some skin condition we started giving her magic pills and look at her skin now it's amazing right but like this is what it might not work for you but this will work for her this will work for him this will work for my clients right not what you should do as soon as you point out people hate you because it sounds like you're preaching it sounds like you have an ego and I just don't think people like that and so I think it's also switching from how I suppose other way switching from how to how I so how to build a massive social media following to how I built the following that I have feel a difference it's really small but really big in terms of how people interpret your message because it's like thank you I appreciate it I think that what happens is when you say it that way you're like you're you're pulling back and saying like hey like I hope this serves you in some way like this is like me opening the kimono this is stuff that's working right now for me whereas the other way you're at the pulpit commanding giving demand you know demands and and commanding people and I just don't think people like that I mean how many people their entire Instagram famous people shaking their finger at you right it sucks I hate it right and so I think it's really speaking on your truths rather than claiming to know the truth and I think to hear and there's a there's a point I probably make later but I'll bring it up now is that everyone is unquestionably an expert on your own life no one can question that if I say I had oatmeal for breakfast this morning I am untouchable you know it was kind of lame but but from the from a factual tip like no one can challenge me on that like this is what I eat every day no one's gonna be like [ __ ] you Alex harming the planet right they're not going to say that because like that's real that's true no one can touch that right but as soon as I say you should have oatmeal for breakfast thank you right it's this big of a difference but it makes all the impact in the world in terms of how people receive the message so question who here makes the content because they want to become famous and feel good about themselves oh who is making stuff because they want it to be received and help the audience right and so the thing is is you have to feed them and not you and I think if you can make that shift I think in my opinion it will be more effective and so if you look at the biggest influencers in the business space because this is a space that I'm kind of in you look at these guys I mean shoot half these guys are talking here so congrats the the event it's awesome very honored to be on stage with them um so that's the acccm at work the Alex crazy content creation method at work by the way um dude talk about that you did which one of these guys made money from their social media following made the money they have from the social media following right and so how many of these people needed the followers none right people like I want to be the next this it's like if you want to be the next that then you got to walk that walk right and so you probably won't be respected as an authority on business until you've achieved Mega success the same reason you look at your competitors like that guy sucks it's like they're looking at you right and it's because why should I listen to you and so here's the good news because you're like well Alex what do I talk about here's the good news you can become a niche specific Authority so rather than going like here's how to live an amazing life right that's like you've got to be Jesus Jesus can do that Jesus can you can't do that Jesus can do that right so you got to go from here to like I'm really good at helping people build ATM businesses I'm really good at how people flip houses in Phoenix right because in that little ocean that little Pond you can be king because you got to compete against 20 guys and you got to do you got to walk the talk right you got to do what you're doing you talk about what you're doing that's it but you can win in that little Pond and I'll show you how to scale from there in a second but you can do that all right and so this is me when I started so I had a couple powerlifting records and I liked working out right and so thank you and so the stuff that I did then was about what I was doing then and so you can't read it but it says how to get rid of stubborn fat on your arms and stomach that's the content I was making then and who is it relevant for just the members at my gym but that was my way of adding value and already had a rapport with them so they're like if I'm going to learn about this identical topic from 100 different people I'd just rather learn about it from you because I like you and I had values based Rapport not expertise like I had General expertise because I looked the way I looked but beyond that I'd have a PhD it's not like I did a ton of research I read the same articles and just tried to make it entertaining that was it and I didn't become Mega famous for that but this made me money this made me enough money to you know grow the company that I had at the time and so from there I leveraged that to grow my first gym and then the gyms after that right and then from there once the gyms grew I started making content about how to grow gyms why except you know how to grow gyms I wasn't like how to scale your SAS company you know I mean like how to reach a billion dollar valuation like I I was like I don't know but this is what worked for my gyms and people are like dude this stuff works I'm like I know because I'm doing I know this is how I do it like I know it works it's how I do it of course I'm doing it here's what's crazy so many people are talking about and teaching stuff that a they have never done and B they are repurposing someone else's content and making a version of it some of them are you [Applause] and that's the thing is is like when you start talking in the theoretical and trying to teach something it's how to rather than how I right so if you do the thing then you just talk about what you just did now later on I think it's the the capture uh capture don't create documents don't create content but I understand that that takes resources like it takes money to get people around you to you know document your life and all that kind of stuff like that that's expensive but I think just even doing Recaps of like this is the stuff that's working right now for us in this context people are like thanks you didn't have to do that thanks for sharing that stuff that's working for you rather than how to and no if you do it that way you will not gain a mega following at first but you will accomplish which will set you on the path for you to be broader later so the Jim Secrets podcast became the game that I published from the gym launch Secrets book which is how to build a profitable gym to 100 million offers book and the difference in scale was pretty tremendous that's my job Secrets but I still think it's a phenomenal book by the way um to that book and that book's done that in less than a year and that other book's been out like four years and so it's not bad it's just sequence people try and go out of sequence they try and say like why am I not Tom Billy you why can't I'm doing everything Tom Billy's doing except for building Quest oops like that's why what he says is relevant you know what I mean because the thing is is like we want everybody here most people seek truth would you say if you're like raise your hand if you seek truth okay so the easiest shortcut for the brain to seek truth is to look at someone who's the most extreme version and then think okay I don't have to apply a lot of decision making filtering here because now I can just absorb this because I can just take this as fact because if Warren Buffett says this is how I should invest I feel okay about that Source even if he's like save your money spend less than you earn invest dollar cost average into the s p and don't buy gold right like he says that stuff and you're like okay now the stay-at-home teacher who's been saving all of her money could say the exact same thing but she just forgot to build Berkshire Hathaway and so the thing is is that and I'm I'm actually very against the whole confidence Mantra of like people being like you got to believe in yourself you gotta you have to do things so that you have evidence that you can support why you are good [Applause] you guys are great and this is like my favorite line from The Matrix it's I think in the second or third camera which one it is but Morpheus is up there and he's like I feel truthfully unafraid not because of the path that lies before me because of the path lies behind me and I think I think it gives a lot of spiritual strength that because I I got asked on an interview they're like how are you so certain I was like you talk about these things like with so much certainty I was like well that's just how I've done it like and it's that depth of experience and knowledge that like no one can question that we built those things that's truth those are the real numbers and so as long as you're not fudging your numbers right and you just say like this is what it is then of course you're [ __ ] certain right because I think confidence is self-delusion it's trying to make up for what you don't have evidence for and I think it's a much easier practice to stop pretending and start doing the stuff that you should be certain about and then you don't have to have bravado you can get up like you can walk on stage and people are like that guy built the big the biggest king and water Empire out there nobody clones in the front and and he built that he doesn't have to have confidence for people to listen to him they will want to listen to everything that he says if that is what they want to do because they'll just go to the person that's done the thing that they want to do so that they don't have to apply a lot of effort in thinking and they can just say I'll do everything this person says right most people cannot separate information from source so what we do is we just seek out good sources I think wisdom is built through being able to take from separating information from source a fool can give you a very wise piece of wisdom or information or a lesson but it's much harder to do that and so the shorthand for most of us is just go to somebody who's an absolute Authority in this thing that has unquestionably a reason that I should listen to them and then just listen to them the downfall of that is that you start taking stock advice from your hairdresser I'm not bashing hairdressers right now this is top of mind right and so you're like I trust you what else you got and then they start talking about things that are not their expertise and then that's when you get in trouble and so the same degree if you probably have an audience that's asking you questions right anybody have an audience to ask some questions raise your hand okay if someone asks you a question that is not something that you have authority on I think you gain more Authority by saying I don't have authority to speak on that and then you gain more respect because because this is what happens damaging admissions are the single greatest thing that built Trust if I say I suck at marriage advice I suck at you know giving happiness advice I suck at whatever but I'm really good at making high returns in the stock market how much more believable is that than I make really good returns in the stock market and I'm really good at marriage and I'm real and and and when you admit your deficits whatever comes after the admission of guilt or the admission of of deficiency is believed more so if I say hey I really suck at a lot of things but you're going to believe what I suppose I say right here that's a sentence structure for persuasion and you can use that in all of the content that you have forever it's also great for negotiating and so anyways I say all this to say it's the path that lies behind you not the path that lies in front of you that will give you the certainty that you want to gain the influence you desire and so my Evolution for me was Fitness First and I just talked about this is what's worked for me people are like Alex how do you eat Twizzlers and cookies all day and have a six-pack and I'm like a genetics B I live at a gym and see I eat this way right and people are like oh so I can have cookies too and have a six-pack and I was like yes and that was relevant for me some people are like super vegan Superstars awesome and they're going to talk what was relevant for them and the people who follow will be like that's I I Vibe with that cool right and so I'm not going to be the best nutrition expert in the world but in terms of like my little little Fife Dome I can rule that right and then I moved up because I started doing well there and people started asking me hey how are you growing your gym I was like well this is how I grew my gym we were like what about business in general like I don't know I've never in an e-commerce business I don't know about manufacturing I don't know about software I don't know many of that stuff but not a grow gym so it only talked about that and the amount of people that that was relevant for this many but for that audience everything right I mean and just for context here there are riches and niches like that company made a lot of money um just saying like it made a lot of money and it didn't make me famous at all and so again the question is do you want to be rich do you want to be famous are you trying to serve you you're trying to serve the audience right and then the last one is like now we've been able to leverage that initial success to build an e-commerce brand to build a software brand to sell those and then now we have a portfolio and so now because we have businesses that span a lot of different areas I can say these are the Frameworks that we use to build all of them I hope this serves you and then people can take that and has anybody used any of the Frameworks that we've for Mosey Nation anybody who's been there have anybody used those Frameworks to make more money one person oh probably not so a big part of that is that you just get better over time and so I said this quote and it went it got shared a lot it's like you're not making as much money as you want because you're not as good as you think you are I'm just being real like I don't know I could have done like the here's my 17 000 content model you know what I mean but like the real is that you're probably not that good yet comma and that's okay like the only person beating you up is you right and so the only way to get better is volume and the only way to get even better than volume is volume times time because volume you can write this down I don't have this in the presentation but this is like the equation of life volume or at least business volume times time equals skill you got to do it a lot of times for a long period of time and you will get better that is a promise you will if you suck today you will suck less tomorrow and eventually one day you will look up and suck so little that you will actually be good and then people will ask you how did you become an overnight success and then instead of saying here's how you cold call you say here's how I did it I hope this serves you right and you can build that trust that way great Alex so how do I make money if I'm just starting out fantastic all right Colton geez always about the money okay I'm kidding oh that's awesome um so here's a couple observations here give away the secrets sell the implementation all right if you want to build an Enterprise that is valuable this is how you do it you can sell info there's nothing wrong with that but if you want to build a brand give away the secret sell the implementation all right because people are like you can give the whole Farm away people still won't do it one percent of people will do it my business model relies on the one percent who do it I mean so like I Bank on that but only one percent are gonna do it so most people need help most people need encouragement most people need accountability most people need somebody who's going to act as their virtual Google because they don't want to type it in it's true right and so one of the side notes that I have here is that if you're not afraid of what you're giving away that you're giving away too much you're not giving away enough and so every time I've written a book or I've made like a presentation that ends up going live I always think to myself like oh God I'm sharing everything what will they do they won't need me anymore because I give them this information they can they don't they'll just keep living their lives and I will become obscure and nothing you know and I will die right that is what it feels I mean you catastrophize but but that's real right it's the it's the opposite though right and there's so many things I feel like that I that I've at least realized for me is a lot of things are the opposite way you expect it's like you only gain your life by giving it right like you only get trust from others by trusting first you only get value back by giving Value First and so if you're afraid of giving away all the secrets that you have I promise you if you make content that does not contain the secrets 99 of people who are the people who are never going to pay you anyways 99 of people will just think you suck because you give nothing so you just make fluff because you're so afraid of giving good stuff away the thing that most people consume is they make one they consume one video and they make a judgment and say I will never consume a video from this person again what a waste of time and so like my big fear with every piece of content is I would rather make fewer pieces of content because I'm so afraid of somebody taking 20 minutes to consume something after watching a bunch of my stuff watching that one and not actively deciding to stop watching but just just don't get enough for the time that they're like I'll just watch something else they don't say like off Galaxy they just pivot a little bit and slowly you fade away and so I would rather have quality over quantity but quality quantity beats just just quality right but I would personally this is me I would personally prefer to have better stuff and give away as many Secrets as I possibly can to get people to start taking steps towards you because what also happens is if someone goes and uses stuff from the YouTube channel and grows from a million dollars a year to three million dollars a year or five million dollars a year they don't have questions on whether or not we can provide value because we already have right and then it makes the sales process dramatically easier because you say what brought you here today and they're like well you made me two million dollars a year I love you and you're like awesome want to get to 10. and they're like sure like how do I know it's going to work because it already has right and you can take that it's a totally different totally different frame for the sale okay and so make your free materials better than everyone else's paid materials I heard this from Tony Robbins and I think it's really true but I think the real real is that most of your stuff is not better than their paid stuff and so that's why it doesn't work and so talk about you really know which is your specialty which is your individual thing that you have experienced that no one can challenge your truth all right and so finally you want to play games where if you wait you win because Goodwill compounds faster than money because the longer you can delay the ask the bigger the ask can be the longer the runway the bigger the plane that can take off of it and so I promise you and this is again gigantic Himalayan grain of salt with the limited experience that I have uh doing organic because I've only done direct to jugular paid ads um cold calling you know affiliate stuff straight pitching I've only done that but I can say that this brand is very special to me because I enjoy what we're building and I'm in no rush to do it and you have time and so the longer you can wait and keep walking with people the longer the compounding works in your favor like it's no coincidence that the biggest people in the business space don't need anything from their audiences right because I think that that compounding process gets interrupted when you do a hard pitch that's my opinion I could be wrong that's my opinion and so the idea is how can we pack when we sell without selling right and I think in that way the compounding will happen faster than the revenue would have otherwise increased if you started trying to make the money fast and so the longer you can delay that the better it's going to be and then you can understand why all these guys play the infinite game of never even wanting to do that right hook because it's like but next year I'm going to have five times the audience and then a year later they're like but next year I'm going to have five times the audience right because as soon as you you shoot your shot you dramatically decrease the Goodwill and so I think that I've at least adapted and this is maybe just a different way of saying it I know Gary's got uh jab jab jab right hook just a personal observation that I've had is that you can go give give give you don't even have to ask people to start handing things to you because if you deposit enough Goodwill in there it just starts coming back and I know that sounds crazy but like the amount of people that DM you're like Hey man can I give you 10 grand for 10 minutes I'm like no I don't do that it's like about 20 grand like no I don't do that right the amount of times people inbound and they're like hey can I have you on my podcast can I have you on my stage can I all these things are happening because you're not asking for anything and it makes people feel uncomfortable it like it makes people feel really uncomfortable they're like how can I buy something from you and you're like you can't they're like ah and I'm like you used to get to three million then we can partner right but but that's it you know I mean there's nothing else and so I think that if we can make that pivot and have that patience uh but like if we're thinking really big picture the reason most people aren't successful is they just can't control themselves like that's it it's impulse control and so there's three things they did this research study that said that Ultra success Ultra successful people have three common traits number one is they have a superiority conflict they think they're better than everybody they think they they can do bigger things second is that they are they have crippling insecurity of not being enough I like that one hits me and then the third one is impulse control so they know where they want to go they have a waif they have a way drive to not be a failure and they stay focused on it because of impulse control and so the idea here is if we can do that we will be more successful and the reason that most people don't make money is because they can't wait 12 months like I had this I have this 18 year old who is my neighbor and I said I'm gonna have you sign a contract that says I want to be a millionaire I was like you got to wait five years and you can't make any money between now and then would you do it he's like yeah I would do it every single person can do that I guarantee you if you delayed your ass for five years and used to provide a value to people for five years you'd have bigger audience than you know what to do with and you'd be a millionaire in five years probably happen a lot faster than that but if you committed to doing it for five years you would but guess what No One's Gonna Do It and that's why most people are successful and so if we come to these events and you have the models and all the stuff right but people still eat cookies when they're trying to lose weight and so it's a concept of local versus global which is there's a local benefit to eating cookies you feel better whatever the global benefit goes down though because you don't get the six-pack you want if that's the goal and you're counting macros you get the idea right and so most people cannot sacrifice local benefit for Global the sales guys don't want to put the notes in the CRM even though the benefits the entire organization because it's a local cost right and so as a side note for operations for business operations are supposed to bring Global benefit in excess of the local cost um and so when we're trying to achieve the things that you're trying to do right the local benefit is just make the ask fast the global benefit is the longer you can wait the bigger it can be and so for me I'm like why not wait as long as humanly possible so I'll wrap this up speak from strengths share your experiences to add to the body of knowledge the problem with a lot of the Social Media stuff and books that are out there now is that the the barrier to entry in terms of what it takes to publish content is so low it's almost not visible right so low and so everybody can produce content back in the day the only way you produce content was like after 30 years of being a researcher you're like this is my entire life's work in one book so I can add to the body of knowledge people are like wow thank you for that and that's how that's how content was made right and if you wanted to do a direct uh you know a marketing piece you had to edit it and put it on a piece of paper and look at it every single way and know that you're gonna pay 50 cents for every single person who's gonna receive it and you better be damn sure it's beautiful right but people don't want like it's so easy now to publish that most stuff is right most stuff sucks and is a total waste of time so just try and talk about the stuff that's not a waste of time that you actually know so you can add to the body of knowledge if you say hey this is what I did consider yourself a mini researcher like these are the experiments I ran in my business these are the experiments I ran in my weight loss clinic these are the experiments I ran in my Plumbing business just talk about the experience because no one can question that second is that teaching on principles is difficult until you've achieved a material amount in the field because there are others who will teach you with more depth of experience it's very difficult to teach business unless you're very successful business because there's just another person who someone will listen to more right but no one can question what you have done and if you have done nothing then do something first and then talk about it because not everyone is an expert on everything but you are unquestionably an expert on your own life so you can share it
UoJh7R8t5Aw,How To Build A Successful Brand Through Social Media In 2023,Unknown,441927,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UoJh7R8t5Aw/hq720.jpg,2022-10-03 00:00:00,1303,GaryVee,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJh7R8t5Aw,I can't imagine being a common sense human being in September 2022 and not understanding that brand is built on social I I genuinely mean that I mean I don't you know you'd have to be so subconsciously religious about what you were taught in college about how brands are built to be anyone that doesn't see it so I love when people like Gary TV works for me I'm like you spent six million dollars on that campaign I'm like it should work that's why most brands are losing they're wrong you're absolutely right you know like I I can't imagine being a common sense human being in September 2022 and not understanding that brand is built on social I I genuinely mean that I mean I don't you know you'd have to be so subconsciously religious about what you were taught in college about how brands are built to be anyone that doesn't see it and so My Philosophy is why would you spend money on something if you can spend less money to achieve the same goal so I love when people like Gary TV works for me I'm like you spent six million dollars on that campaign I'm like it should work I'm like the question is did you spend six million dollars on creative and media in Tick Tock YouTube Facebook Pinterest influencers podcast like YouTube like what would happen if you actually spent that same money perfectly in the Contemporary environments and so you know it's weird because I've been on this journey for 15 years um and I was incredibly empathetic the first seven years because I knew people didn't know but I literally have dinners now with decision makers who will spend the first 30 minutes talking about how social media can completely controls their child's life then they'll spend the next 15 minutes talking about politics and how social media needs to be regulated because of how powerful it is as a proxied against democracy and then we'll transition into talking about selling cereal and makeup and they don't think social media can move the needle I'm like so let me get this straight you think this platform is so powerful that we need to regulate it because it could put democracy on its knees but you don't think it can sell cereal and so you know my point of view is that it's the most underpriced macro platform to get actual consumption it's also a place if you understand it well that really addresses the elephant in the room which is the elephant in the room in marketing today is that creative's too expensive and because it's too expensive you can't actually get the full advantage of the media opportunities that exist if it costs you too much to make creative you're not going to make 87 pieces of creative a day to distribute against 35 different consumer segmentations against 21 social platforms you'll never do that you can't and so yeah I mean to me in 2022 it's kind of an exhausting conversation to even like like I'm struggling to get going to even be in the combo because I can't understand how people don't see it the only thing that makes sense to me is when people are in corporations and the internal scoring system doesn't justify it then I understand you're trying to protect your job and you should you have a mortgage and a family but if we're talking real life like human beings like our kids health depends on the results how you don't understand that this is the place that Brand's built I don't know this is Facebook Twitter and Tumblr stock I made a very big bet 15 years ago where I took every dollar I had in the bank and invested in three companies Facebook Twitter and Tumblr obviously that changed the course of my life but the funny story of why I'm pointing here it's actually the answer to your question when I invested in Tumblr I called my brother and I said AJ Tumblr is going to be bigger than Facebook and Twitter it's gonna be the biggest one of them all and he said why and I said because Facebook and Twitter you follow people Tumblr you follow things you're interested in and so even back then I was fascinated by the interest graph over the social graph now that didn't become true because there's a lot of other variables to why a company will be successful including who's operating it but what is true is that what Tick Tock has tapped into in the last three years has completely changed and will change everything we're all doing and is the answer to your question the way it's changed is the following now not now art not math is the most important equation in doing creative on social the algorithms now reward retention more than ever which means they're going to show you things you want right things you want are far more predicated on the creative than the math that gets them in front of you instead of the Facebook environment we all grew up with where you could get in front of the people you wanted to based on great data and then you would pound them with advertising what we need to win on now is creative that is advertising that is educating or entertaining AKA creating consideration then once that is proven then we can convert Those ads to Performance ads but we have to start with the creative instead of what everybody here knows which is the creative has been a secondary part of the equation which is why we spend 80 percent of our money on the media and 20 on the creative and as many people here know people haven't really been doing marketing and branding they've been doing sales if you look at the creative of the DTC Brands over the last 15 years it's much more couponing and and and newspaper advertising than it is marketing that has completely changed in the last three to four years and everybody here has to leave with two things one we need to actually get into the creative business and make things that people want to watch two we need to make it for many different consumer segmentations this is not television where you make a piece of vanilla and you hope that everybody on Earth wants it this is Baskin Robbins and we need to make a lot of different flavors and go up and then see the common ground and then understand what our brand stands for based on 37 different consumer segmentations of relevance once you can understand the upside down model of how brands are built because the internet now rules not the television then you can really start to understand what to do web 3.0 um is really slang for the consumer blockchain and why the brands should care about it is if they are a brand that does not want to transact on their business AKA sell it in the next five years then they should really care because it's 1999 2000 all over again and 2005 internet was a hell of a lot more important than 99 internet and 2000 what are we in 22 and 2027 nfts are going to matter a hell of a lot more than 2022 nfts so why you have to care is it is my deep belief that what I saw the internet do to communication starting in 1996 and being in every day is exactly what the consumer blockchain is about to do for transaction that everybody here thinking about first party data sustainable e-commerce with high cost shipping AKA how do we get people into memberships and monthly and and packages instead of one-off skus and a million other things that you think about day to day the blockchain's better at solving it than the internet most people even in this room which is which I highly respect and this is not a Razz this is being empathetic that people are busy and haven't had the time to spend 50 hours on it most people even in this room haven't really synthesized their strategies on the fact that the internet is different from the blockchain and if you haven't done that then you don't even understand the functionality of the blockchain and how do I know this because it's what happened with people in The Logical real world were unable to do with the internet when I was pitching wine library.com in 1996 literally everybody who I talked to said to me who would ever go on the internet to buy a bottle of wine I can go to the store and get it and my response was everyone and so what what and that blew people's [ __ ] mind in 1996 right because we still had people and you all know this almost every single person on this calls parents was scared to put a credit card into a computer in 1999. and so what we're seeing now with people's fear like most people in this room that [ __ ] on nfts if they do don't realize that they've become their parents right they're they're demonizing a technology without fully understanding it and so for me I actually think nfts are going to be one of the most significant Innovations in cpg land because when I see nfts my brain goes to LTV it goes to retention it goes to event marketing it goes to monthly subscription it goes to how I'm going to control first party data and not be at the mercy of Google Facebook and Tick Tock when you do your 50 hours things get real different real fast and that would be my takeaway here you know unfortunately we just ended this summer where you probably could have snuck it in but if you're listening and you understand the macro of what I'm saying please use the winter holidays to really actually actually read on what a blockchain does how it is a ledger that affirms a transaction that nobody on Earth can alter and what impact that has and then you are the currency I am the central bank to be friends I collect the royalties I have the affirmation I'm not at Mercy of any technology stack or government stack this is a big deal it's a big deal but it's internet 1996 and people are glossing over it especially because we have the internet this time last time we didn't even have the internet yet so it's a very important very important technology that I think can really matter especially for some of the creative people here who are interested in General Mills or the Leo Burnett era of the 60s where you create characters and the value of those characters like I'm very into that and so if you're if you know there's a very big reason I'm passionate about this technology I understand the macro of the transaction thing to the communication thing I just referenced I'm also highly affected by character development the Marlboro Man Keebler elves things of that nature and I I see nfts as a substantial playground for that these characters you see back here my Disney be friends I fully intend to building a multi-billion Dollar cpg business that looks like Fruity pal bills or Mary Ruth's Organics or things of that nature what why I'm very empathetic for so many people being confused is I live in this every day and I've been watching it since 2017 quietly when when crypto kitties hit and like I've been watching and waiting for my timing of the entry which obviously was about 18 months ago the reality is ninety percent of the people that were in it last year were there for the quick buck and that DNA is very off-putting to people that are in things for so unlike the internet which it was in 95 and 6 where the crew was a bunch of nerds that nobody fully understood what the hell they were talking about that's one version of like a niche that you gotta kind of like understand how to use this one was very difficult because there was so much money involved and get rich quick and scams and like all the worst Dynamics more like extreme Wall Street Dynamics which is why we had Internet stock issues in the 90s and then on top of everything else you have social media so you have all these people gloating hey I bought a donkey with a cigar up its ass and made 400 000 what normal human being thinks that's a good thing and so I was very empathetic to the confusion I continue to be empathetic to the confusion but let there be no confusion the consumer blockchain is the biggest invention since the internet and every person in this room is going to be highly affected by it because all of you will pay your taxes and buy future homes on it so you better figure it out because when you made fun of your mom for not using email or a smartphone you're literally about to be that person with the blockchain in the next decade so I highly recommend you figure it out I do think believe it or not the luxury brands are a little bit ahead because they're thinking about loyalty and retention what you're seeing from lvmh and others in my opinion without knowing everything that they're thinking but watching carefully I do think they have a sense of wait a minute this is an opportunity for us to create communities things like Amex Black Card like I I see certain nuances there so if I was to tell you all to look I'm always scared at this early of a stage to say go look at Puma because it's really hard to understand what it all means what I would say is get grounded in the underlining technology then you can do your damage you'll understand how it works for you the problem is when I look at internal teams across the board it's a pretty bad sich because most people are mailing it in and they're either blindly DTC and want it to be sales and that's how the creatives being justified or if they're even flirting with creative they just think the 24 year old knows what to do on Tick Tock and so they're not even evaluating it so we have an acronym internally at Vayner called sock strategic organic content and all day long I just walk around on slack email and in the halls and say it's the s in sock that everything lives and dies by here which means do you actually know how to make creative for Pinterest versus LinkedIn versus YouTube shorts versus Tick Tock and that is creative strategy and platform strategy and understanding attention and culture at a PhD level and yet most people just mail in their social and they care about all this other stuff their brand and billboards and Remnant TV and I'm just watching this landscape and so a to drive down cost there are plenty of 22 to 30 year olds you can hire that will give you a better cost basis that are very capable of producing the content but you need somebody at the top that understands the s in sock Like A Champion or the whole thing's a waste or B I believe we're 24 months away because I'm in this business we have gotten so far ahead of everybody in the last 24 months in Fortune 500 land that there are now copycat agencies or the big companies are starting to take the creative seriously and are looking to drive down costs get away from 300 000 videos for television and getting into two hundred thousand dollars a month of creative but making 650 pieces of creative that are meaningful for brand and sales and so I'm starting to see the market go there so finding someone who does it for real for real like for a lot of mid-tier Brands piggyback Brands really spending forty to fifty thousand dollars a month on Creative that really builds brand to many different consumer segmentations but also shows organic virality which then become your performance ads is where a lot of brands are going to go whereas they're mailing in that fee right now and they'd rather spend it on media dollars but their CAC numbers are going through the roof because iOS 14.5 came along and changed the game and there's just a lot going on in the Tactical operational side by the way influencers really focusing on micro influencers because you get content and distribution uh being smarter about your partnership deals like if you're going to do a partnership get at all costs getting content out of the system and not having creatives that think about ideas but having creatives that think and make I'll give you a great comp people always like Gary but how do I know Tick Tock will be here in five years I'm like well when you bought trillion dollar commercials on Seinfeld you weren't trying to guess when they were going to end the show right you didn't like you didn't need NBC to promise you that friends would play Forever you just bought ads on Friends when the attention was on Friends so for me I'm on emotional I don't give a [ __ ] about Tick Tock Facebook YouTube Instagram could care less if they all disappeared off the face of the Earth I'd be pumped because all that attention would have to go somewhere and I think most people would struggle to figure out where and that's my favorite thing to do right so I would say a couple things number one it's more about like knowing if something resonates is the most common sense thing in the world if you're a DTC brand you can literally see it if you're asking for call to actions and if you're doing it for Branding the qualitative comments show you one of the reasons I'm obsessed with social creative is not only does it build brand and give me a framework to be able to build relevance at scale it's also the single greatest consumer insights machine of all time but back to the essence sock 25 of the creative that I personally in my brand and what Vayner does that I put out is strictly made to get insights of curiosity of hypotheses I have about the consumer literally it is made to get the comments so that I can build on the hypothesis to create affirmation to create better content and so it's the most common sense thing on earth to know if it's working you see it in the comments and you see it in the sales if you choose to make it more of a sales DNA it's a hell of a lot easier to know if your social creative is resonating than if you're television or sponsorship is resonating when we did television broad everybody saw our [ __ ] vanilla when you do relevance at scale in this environment fewer people cross over and seeing the different contexts it was the reverse everybody saw your Heineken ad and if it didn't resonate to them which oh by the way it didn't to 90 because everything is vanilla when it's in a 30 second video because it has to be because it has to do everything for everybody in such a short period of time so ironically we're in a let we're in a place now where we can everybody always goes to fear oh schizophrenia I go to we used to sell vanilla and hope that 10 gave a [ __ ] now we can sell on relevance and have a lot more people care about our Brands what has happened in business is everyone has gotten so infatuated with scale and efficiencies that we don't amortize out the actual value so for me and it's so funny that John just joined I don't know if you guys see him on screen or if I'm only here but if you see do you guys see him so jamo like held he heads up all of Boehner's philosophy on media investment and so we talk about day trading attention and all things we talk about all the time but if you ask jamo and I what is our favorite thing that we're working on kind of in our secret lab because we're the weird ones is a scalable human infrastructure that has 17 employees that work all day to be able to reach out to every single person on social and be able to price them out and if they are a good buy at 850 to do a influencer ad then it's a good buy if they're four thousand bucks and they charge 8.50 and it costs us 27 an hour to execute we're in but nobody wants overhead on unscalable right and so like scaling the humans is the most interesting thing for me right now and so when we talk about it's the biggest thing one of the reasons I'm ultra confident about building be friends is I'm right now building that infrastructure so that people are every YouTube family on Earth is opening up the toys and the trading cards every cool person is wearing the hoodies and the t-shirts at massive scale to me everyone became infatuated with working media and became one dimensional CAC in LTB monsters and are overpaying for awareness and I'm looking to win on depth and scaling the unscalable and so influencers at scale are really interesting because nobody everyone's focused on Gross versus net the net result of your cost of getting an influencer that you paid four thousand dollars for that is worth twenty six thousand is remarkable because you get the content and the media distribution but you also get the word of mouth and the cosine and the endorsement and the long tail affinity foreign [Music]
lqmA-LrQzcY,The Ultimate Social Media Marketing Strategy,Unknown,361175,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lqmA-LrQzcY/hq720.jpg,2023-09-11 00:00:00,2720,GaryVee,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqmA-LrQzcY,apple does not sell Nike does not sell most of their product through Google AdWords or affiliate marketing they sell most of their products because they built brand a lot of people here are incredibly focused on selling so they like Google AdWords because it converts better lower funnel conversion based marketing right the reality is that's great selling's important that's how a business Grooms but when you are building brand when people care about you or your business that is the ultimate form of selling there is no affiliate there's no portal there's no Google ads that are more powerful than building a brand Brazil what's good [Applause] you know I gave a lot of thought on the long flight from New York to the show on what did I want to talk about what what would bring the most value to the audience here with the makeup of what I knew about who's here and obviously a lot of people are here on different parts of their journey in building their brand their business their happiness and what really came to mind for me as I started to go through it in my head was there was two places and that is really attention and accountability that the two places that I could talk about today that would bring the most value was to focus on those two things the concept of where is the attention of all the places that everyone here wants to reach and then how accountable is everyone here to themselves and even more importantly to the team or the people that they're building with so that's where I'm going to go on this the reason I like to focus on attention so much is when I think about my career actually this is a good question how many people here are familiar with me and my content raise your hand thank you now I'm going to ask who's not familiar don't worry you will not hurt my feelings I just want to get a sense because I want to know where I want to go how many people here are not familiar with me and don't know my content raise your hands okay that hurts I paid attention I don't like you I just first of all I'm extremely humbled by how many are for the ones that aren't but even for the ones that are I'm going to start here because it really is going to matter for where I think all of you are going over the next 10 years even when I was six years old and wanted to sell lemonade when I was a child in New Jersey the thing that I spent most of my time on was not making the lemonade though it had to be good enough to drink not standing behind the desk or the table that I had for my lemonade I spent most of my time walking up and down the streets of New Jersey and trying to watch Cars drive by and try to figure out which tree or what street sign to put my lemonade stand sign on that gave me a better chance to sell lemonade I didn't understand what I was doing at six years old when I was 11 years old I sold trading cards and collectible stickers at shows I spent so much time thinking about how I would build out my table and where I would put what cards and what stickers and I would walk the whole show and pay attention to how people set up their tables what I was doing at that age and then when I turned 14 and 15 and started working for my dad's liquor store I would watch customers walk through the front door of the liquor store and I would pay attention to how they would walk where they would go what displays they looked at what shelves they looked at and what I was doing my whole life and what I do for a living now and what every single person at this conference whether you work for a big brand or you're an entrepreneur whether you've been doing it for five years or today is the first day you're going on this journey what I was doing then and what everyone needs to be doing now is following the attention too many people here get comfortable with one or two platforms to make content or one or two ways of how they sell product and they become in love with it and they become complacent and they stop evolving to where the attention is my career as a content creator started on YouTube in 2006 but it was Twitter in 2007 and it was Instagram in 2011 and it was all these other platforms along the way snap and Tick Tock and Linkedin and YouTube shorts and Facebook and even ones that didn't last forever how many people here by show of hands remember Vine the app remember that that didn't last forever but in the two years that it was dominating or the year and a half a lot of attention was grown from that platform more importantly a lot of people learned by doing Vine how to make short videos which is now one of the most important ways to communicate in our society the biggest thing that I'm trying to leave this conference with is getting everyone here dramatically more accountable to focus on attention not where you want to make content but where your customer is you may not like Tick Tock or YouTube or Facebook or Instagram or Twitter but if your customer's attention is there you not liking it is only achieving one thing you losing out on more customers this is an incredibly important framework and it's a very big issue in today's world because most people are not producing enough content to enough places a lot of people here are incredibly focused on selling so they like Google AdWords because it converts better lower funnel conversion based marketing right the reality is that's great selling's important that's how a business grooms but when you were building brand when people care about you or your business that is the ultimate form of selling there is no affiliate there's no portal there's no no Google ads that are more powerful than building a brand apple does not sell Nike does not sell most of their product through Google AdWords or affiliate marketing they sell most of their products because they've built brand the number one goal from every single person here and every business here is to build a brand when you build brand you don't have to sell it comes to you how do you build brand is what I'm passionate about and where do you build brand is what I'm passionate about and that's why I start this talk and I'm focused on attention and accountability most people in this room have not been accountable to executing against your big words I've been flying the last day and yesterday this conference went on and today when I land and I searched Twitter X and all the other platforms and I see a lot of people here commenting about what they're doing at this conference and what they're up to and of course I have to hit the translation because it's in Portuguese and I want to know what you said and when I read it a lot of people here are talking big game a lot of you are talking about building huge companies and you're going to be massive and you're going to build big stuff and then when I click on that account and try to find what they're doing on the internet they're producing very little content we must be accountable that if we're talking big game that our actions have to match our mouth thank you thank you what do I mean by that I mean I'm 47. I started marketing when I was 15. really actively for my father's business that means I've been marketing for over 30 years 30 years ago how many people here are under 35 years old raise your hands first of all let's clap it up for all these young [ __ ] so kids that are under 35 let me tell you a story when I was a young man marketing for my dad's liquor store and wine store if you wanted to get people to know about you you had to pay you had to pay I had to pay a newspaper to put an advertising in the newspaper I had to pay a cable company to run my TV commercial I had to pay for a billboard to show my sign I had to pay the marketing Direct Mail company to make a flyer and send it into your mailbox so you would see it I had to pay today the attention of the world lives in here the things that dominate here is gaming and entertainment and social networks people here complain that they're not getting a lot of views on their videos on Instagram or Tick Tock or these platforms but they have forgotten that it's free [Music] let me say this nice and slow today if you were to advertise on social networks the cost of showing up not making it but showing up is free this is crazy Google which I used a lot Google AdWords how many people here do Google AdWords pretty aggressively from your business a little higher I just want to get a sense a lot of you Google charges you money when somebody clicks not everybody converts you try to figure out if the amount you pay do enough people convert that it's worth your money but it still costs you money The Social Network Revolution is insane it is free to build brand most people in this room most people in Brazil most people in South America most people in the world do not produce enough content for how big the opportunity is for free attention that is the biggest elephant in this room today it is a wow it's a wow because it's [ __ ] free and yet people will complain and say oh Instagram Shadow Banned Me Nobody Shadow band meet you you just suck at social media and so I come here on this long flight to pound here for the next 45 minutes attention attention will get you everything you want you want to sell a course attention you want to sell a t-shirt attention you want to be the mayor of this town attention you want to raise some money for your non-profit because you're passionate about it attention you want to be an actor attention attention it is the only asset that everyone in here must Chase to produce what they want being unemotional about where the attention is is very important too many of you have demonized platforms out of your subjective opinion a bad experience and we must get over that hump once you get over the hump once you sit in this room and understand that everything you want to happen is about building brand and sales in social networks then you start having to get good at it right it's like health and fitness I can tell you the way to get healthier is to eat better and go to the gym and once you understand that that there's no magic pill then you can do it the problem is there's a good way to work out and there's a bad way there's a good way to eat clean and healthy and there's an okay way where you get tricked if it's really healthy or not the thing I spend all my time on today in my career even though I've been in this for a long time on the flight here with Dustin with raghav all I was talking about was the strategies on the creative that we're posting in Social is the thumbnail good how many people here are familiar with Mr Beast the YouTuber raise your hands Mr Beast reportedly spends a hundred fifty thousand dollars per thumbnail on his YouTube videos let me say that nice and slow one more time for everybody Mr Beast spends a hundred fifty thousand dollars in testing and production for every thumbnail of the videos he puts up on YouTube now obviously he makes an incredible amount of money from his YouTube videos but understand the it's not about how much I need everybody here to understand the commitment most people hear when they post on social media post because they're following a trend that they think will do well or some [ __ ] they want to say but they give no thought and this is the most important line maybe of the entire talk so I want everyone to pay attention they give no thought to the science of the art no thought of the math around the art to build the brand I know there's a lot of people here who do conversion and lower funnel and affiliate and Google AdWords I I love that world I lived in it in the you know late 90s early 2000s I just want that audience which is a big part of this percentage to hear why I'm focusing so heavily on social it's because of attention one more time how many people here are very aggressively doing Google AdWords and before you raise your hand Google AdWords is a big part of your revenue for your business please raise your hand raise it so for the appreciate it for the 100 people that just raised their hand their Reliance on Google AdWords is something they have to think about every day because I don't think I have to tell anyone here what's happening more and more people are using Ai and chat CBT to do search than Google if the attention goes away from Google to search well you're not going to be able to convert as easily if you're getting your business from referrals and Affiliates let me promise you they're getting their traffic from Google if AI wins the next three to five years and most of us are going to chat GPT or something like it instead of Google it's just what Google did to the Yellow Pages and all the directories of before all the money used to be made by people that would open the Yellow Pages or the directories and they would call a business that went to Google that went out of business Google is not the end state Google is not the last way it's going to be we are all sitting here today and all very aware how many people here have played with an AI bot have used or tried chat GPT raise your hand actually stand up if you've used an AI bot like stand up I want everybody to visualize this is very important if you've used chat GPT or something like it to search something or get information please stand up and don't be lazy this is very important to everybody I don't care how tired you are get the [ __ ] up if you've used chat CPT I love you back now listen before you sit down because some of you are lazy look around look around look around this is just starting this is just starting you can sit thank you for doing that for me because here's what's important do you know what I am scared about every day when I love people in business that they become too high on their own Supply meaning they become complacent to what's working today without realizing that the thing that's making their living and their business is in danger even if you lose 30 percent of the attention on search to chat GPT or something like it that is going to raise your cost of clicks and acquisition dramatically enough to maybe not make it viable to what you sell it doesn't have to go to zero for it to be a problem for you as a matter of fact as people start changing their behavior and 20 or 30 percent less go to Google to look as that number goes down the people you're competing with to be the first result in a Google ad are going to start paying more because they're going to start getting nervous and it's going to drive your cost up to compete this is very important I see a lot of smart people shaking their heads right now listen to me my friends six years how many people here have been following my content for more than five years raise your hand for the people that just raised their hand you all remember five years ago when I was yelling tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock and all of you thought it was little girls dancing I thought it's where the world's attention was about to go many of you who just raised their hands did not take advantage of going hard on Tick Tock when I told you and you left money on the table it doesn't mean that your business isn't good it doesn't mean that things aren't fine it just means that you could have been twice as big you know when people are like Gary you keep talking about doing this and that but my business is doing six million I'm like what's wrong with 12 million and more importantly when you're complacent and you become lazy and you become one-dimensional on one or two things that work almost always six million becomes 3 not 12. my friends I come to Brazil today in the late summer of 2023 to tell you a very distinct message I've been following attention on the internet for 20 years religiously we are in a moment right now where there's more change coming in the next 24 months than I've seen in a long time since really 2005-6-7 when Myspace and Facebook and Twitter and I was like okay this is different this is not blogging this is different this is not dig and Reddit this is different and obviously social networks took us to adultly different place we sit here today with AI looming you just saw how many people stood up we sit here today with the platforms becoming more complicated and the content requiring you to be better at it how many people here feel like they're fairly active and are serious about doing business on Instagram raise your hands I just want to say raise your hands high for all the people that just raised their hands do we not all agree and you can just head nod do we not all agree that over the last 12 months six months that the organic reach on Instagram has down down quite a bit right I see it right it's gone down because all that is happening is supply and demand very simple Concept in business supply and demand yesterday more content was produced on Instagram than any other day in the history of life however in the last four years an enormous amount of the attention has gone to tick tock so if more content was made yesterday than ever before but in the last three to four years an extraordinary amount of attention hours has gone to tick tock and YouTube shorts and other places what do you think is going to happen with your organic reach more ads have been spent on Instagram yesterday than ever before what do you think is going to happen to your organic reach this is all supply and demand of attention but like I started this talk this is also time for all of you to become accountable today's Champion is tomorrow's loser there are a lot of people sitting here feeling good about themselves based on 2015 marketing Behavior and they don't realize that the shift is coming and the two or three things that they do well are starting to change right in front of their eyes and instead of being accountable and putting in more work to learn they're putting their head in the sand and saying [ __ ] AI I don't care about Tick Tock I don't need this I've got this figured out good news for me I respect that you have to live your life if you decide to lose 20 to 50 percent of your business's revenue or your growth that's on you you're not my brother you're not my mother I actually don't give a [ __ ] if you listen to any of my advice on the flip side the last 20 years of my career has been very very very enjoyable I know that in two years I will be on a flight to Dubai I'll catch up on all my work and five of you in this audience will email me and say I was at your talk in August of 23 in Brazil and I was strictly doing affiliate lower funnel and you convinced me to get serious about building brand and social and focusing on what's going on in Ai and I just want to thank you because you were right I was slowly declining a little bit or I was flat in 22 and 23 and since there my business has doubled that is an email that I am lucky enough to get almost daily over the last 10 years that is my intent to be here and that is what I wish on all of you how many people here have more than three employees raise your hand more than three raise your hands okay I'll go there then I'm going to talk on this for a few minutes given how many people raised their hands accountability when you have employees the number one thing that I focus on and I think about for the people in here that want to grow is the inability to understand the biggest truth of when you own a business which is if you have employees you work for them they don't work for you this is a big deal most people it's just natural it's the way we think I know how the world works most people think I'm paying you [ __ ] do [ __ ] for me makes sense and it's not wrong it's actually very logical and I understand I also have a belief in that to some degree however back to my purpose with this talk today to everyone here if you have the emotional strength to understand it's the reverse I promise you you've started down the path of actually growing your business growing up in my father's business I saw how my dad thought about his relationship with his employees the first time I went to the store to work he told me to keep an eye on them because he thought some of them were trying to steal it was an old school mentality that he learned growing up in Russia where I was born today a lot of us business owners are worried about the reverse we're worried about our employees being too entitled not wanting to do stuff wanting to get paid to do little I understand covid created new variables there are people that don't even want to go into an office literally asking someone to go to an office five days a week now seems like you're crazy the world changes I get that but following and finding your balance on being a leader to your people will get so much more value out of them you would be shocked vaynermedia is now 2 000 people globally vaynerx because we have six or seven companies every time I hire someone new that's senior and they come into the company they are shocked by how long a lot of the employees have been in the company the company's only 14 years old we have dozens and dozens and dozens of people that have been there for 9 10 11 years for people here in marketing they know advertising agencies people last two years maybe three the reason is because I live what I believe in but there's a business Reason Not only does it feel well not doesn't feel good to do right by your people it's good for your business when people stay in a company for a long time they have institutional knowledge Sports I know this country loves its Sports sports do you know what one of the biggest variables in sports besides having competition in your soul is speed speed matters speed matters in sports and speed matters in business so much how many people here that have three or four or more employees the number one hidden problem they have is they're in too many meetings the number one poison for their company is meetings are too long and there's too many of them when you have people that stay with you a long time meetings can be 15 minutes instead of one hour because everyone's talking the same [ __ ] language I have meetings with people on the way to the bathroom and not even talking to them when you work with somebody for 10 years I could leave my desk go to the bathroom look them in the face head nod and we both know exactly what the [ __ ] we need to do next that is how you scale that is how you build a bigger business I implore everyone here implore everybody here to get dramatically more serious of building a positive culture in this business now that doesn't mean coddle your people I'm not saying for you to create entitlement and let everyone be lazy I'm saying be a human being and care about your employees talk to them understand because when you have employees employees care about different things I have employees who want more money makes sense I have employees who don't necessarily want more money they want more vacation time because they just had a child makes sense I have some employees who you know in my mind are a little bit insecure and so for them it's not the money it's not the vacation time they just want a more senior title on their LinkedIn and their resume as a boss as a leader it is not your judge to judge what your employees want it's your job to understand what your employees want and try to make it happen Brazil understood good attention attention can be very overpriced and it could be very underpriced and there is no general rule how many people here do for their company have done marketing with influencers or creators you've paid an influencer or Creator to bring awareness to your business raise your hands raise them hi please okay for the hundred or so that have raised their hands influencers in general remarkably possible for it to be underpriced you can pay an influencer a couple hundred bucks a couple thousand bucks ten thousand bucks and get enormous return on your investment on the flip side how many people here have paid influencers and it was a [ __ ] show did not do anything raise your hands how many people here have done things with influencers and it was a very good thing and was good for your business raise your hands almost everyone who raised their hand for the first thing raised their hand for the second thing this is why I want to talk about attention per behavior in the world we live in today many of you may ask is influencer marketing good the answer is Maybe it can be good it can be bad that is actually the same for everything if you think about it a football is that good for your business for Messi it was very good for Ronaldo it was very good they made billions of dollars the ROI of a football for those human beings was a lot for me I played two weekends ago and I hurt my hamstring that was negative Roi that is the same for everything we're going to talk about to close this out the following Platforms in Brazil have huge opportunities for business growth but you may do well with it or you may not do well with it it is based on your skill on how you pick the influencers what you're looking for the influencers to do the direction you've given the influencers to do what you want to do and the same is true for the content you make on YouTube on Facebook on Instagram on Snapchat on Pinterest every one of the top 10 Platforms in the world are an incredible opportunity for many people here the problem is if you think back to the other things you've done email marketing affiliate Google AdWords it didn't do well at first either potentially because you didn't know what you were doing the key here is to leave this conference understanding that you have to put it in the work put in the work to actually be good at the craft let me give you some things to think about tactically to be good at the craft how many people here post every day on social media raise your hands every day on social media raise your hands higher please how many people here do not post on social media at all raise your hands John Paulo get up here you can get up here get up here let's clap it up for this pioneer this is a very amazing man in 2023 he does not post in social media at all we must clap for him louder how are you very fine you could speak in Portuguese tell them in Portuguese why you do not post Ed I'm very lazy lazy is that true you believe that I don't give a [ __ ] you don't give a [ __ ] no to me anyone who has hit the highest level of happiness to me the highest level of happiness is I don't give a [ __ ] as much as I want to tell him what's good about this and what's good about that this wonderful bearded man had has achieved the highest level of humanity we must give him a standing ovation he doesn't give a [ __ ] stand up and clap up [Applause] I almost feel like my talk should be done now for the rest of you who have not achieved the final stage of humanity and still give some [ __ ] it's re I'm really really passionate about a couple things one is self-awareness I didn't know where that gentleman was going to go with his answer he went to the my favorite place but one of the things I recognize today is when I sit here and say to all of you regardless of what you do B2B SAS small company big company Creator entrepreneur real estate selling course I don't know what you do what I do know is that it's inconceivable whether LinkedIn or YouTube Shorts Facebook or Instagram that those platforms that are free are not the best use of your time to get good at and put a lot of effort towards including hiring people and spending money on it because it's free to distribute it it's not free to make it unless you do it yourself and your time is not free right as I sit here and not knowing what that gentleman was going to say I do think there's a starting point to the journey that I want to push all of you to make more of which is self-awareness not everybody in this Hall in this conference should be making videos on the internet they're not good at it and that's okay you can practice and get better but maybe it's just not for you and that's okay I think the biggest problem today is that most people feel to be good at social media you have to be on camera and that is crazy you have a business when you have a business you do not have to be on camera it's a good thing to be on camera if you like it or you're good at it you should be on camera but if you are not good at it and you do not like it and you genuinely understand yourself I know no matter how much I practice singing I will only be so good I will be better in a year if I practice singing every day then I would sing tonight but I'll still be at a very low level I can never be Beyonce I can practice football like I did two centers ago but I promise you there is no World Cup in my future other things I was able to maximize all that practice as a child selling lemonades and baseball cards and wine led me to being a very successful entrepreneur that is true for everyone here you need to figure out if you are not doing this because you don't want to and you're not good at it or because of the thing that scares me the most in this room today that the reason most of you aren't doing what I'm talking about even though you didn't need me here to fly 12 hours to tell you to do it is because you're scared of other people's opinions when they leave comments on what you post the biggest thing I fear is that you are not living your happiest life or your most successful business because you are worried about the opinion of someone who is anonymous on the internet I'm just going to give you one tidbit on this if a human being lives the life where they spend their time going around social networks finding your content and leaving something nasty about you that you are not good looking that you are stupid that you don't know what you're talking about do not feel bad for yourself feel bad for them do you know how sad of a life it is to take your time to seek out people on the internet that you don't know and leave nasty comments to make them feel bad that person is in a very bad place when I say feel bad for them I don't mean say [ __ ] you and be mad at them I'm saying have compassion and sympathy for them that they are in a bad place in their lives that they are spending their valuable time to try to hurt your feelings someone they probably don't even know if we can get the world to have more compassion for the people that are nasty the world could be in a much better place and more importantly thank you and more importantly that's a big goal you'll be happier if you can find compassion and empathy for people that are dragging you down do not let your self-esteem be wrapped up in the fact that you only got 25 views on a video I only got 25 views on my first video too and my second and my fourth and my ninth nobody was watching my [ __ ] [ __ ] but I knew that the video on the internet thing in 2006 was gonna happen and I put in the work all the best stuff is happening when you're putting in the work not the results so please be self-aware of who you are are you insecure or are you self-aware and realize video is not your format but maybe the written word is you put a picture let me give you a good example the number one mistake that almost everyone here is making on Instagram is they're mailing it in when they do the copy on their post they're not writing enough or thoughtfully enough on the caption on their post they do the video in the picture they think that's what it is and on the written word they just say huh say something funny something clever three words and they're done post if everybody here started writing three or four sentences in detail that brought value to the video that they're posting they would see enormous growth from their Baseline overnight maybe for you you're not good on video but you can take a picture of your product or your service or your industry and then write three paragraphs on your Instagram post and that's how you grow there's a hundred different ways to win this game the only way to guarantee that you don't win is by doing nothing about it there is not enough content being made in enough platforms from this group here I'll give you an example of another thing that some of the more advanced people here are not thinking about I would argue that 10 to 15 of my content that I make I make for information but why I'm really making it is I'm basically asking the audience a question and I'm reading all the comments to get the insights that I'm getting the consumer insights and the pulse of the world through putting out content just for the reactions and the comments and the answers the more people here get curious and focused and strategic about the content they make the more the upside will be my friends we are living in the greatest era of marketing and business ever the opportunities are bigger than ever more of us can get more of a piece of the pie than ever we have the biggest Platforms in the world of attention costing free this is insane not only that if you have to do a regular job while you trace your dream when I was growing up there was no internet and so you worked your job nine to seven and when you went home you couldn't build your dream every person here can work their nine to five and then build their dream on the internet at six seven eight nine ten we are walking around Earth everybody Brazil the US Europe we are walking around and spending all of our time talking about what's not working complaining about what's not working deciding who's in control and we're not and yet all of us here as we sit here today are living in the best that the world has ever been health-wise money-wise opportunity wise the best you don't believe that because you read and consume content on social media and mainstream media that tells you it's not but take a step back and pay very close attention I promise you you have way more opportunity than your grandmother and grandfather had promise and the most interesting part for me on that is we're not taking advantage of it so as I wrap up the actual perspective it is time for every person in the seat right now to become accountable there's nobody stopping you you may think there is but it's not true there's not a single person on Earth stopping you you were capable and you have how many people here have a cell phone raise your hands who here does not have a cell phone can you put the lights on does anybody not have a cell phone no [ __ ] don't be funny do you really actually okay you're being funny thank you not one person here does not have a cell phone fair enough but she's not here this is the remote control of the universe every single thing that you are sitting here on the ground or in a seat hoping and dreaming could happen can happen because of this the only thing that's stopping you is your mental perspective or your lack of knowledge on how to do it please no matter what you do please get serious about LinkedIn YouTube YouTube shorts Twitter X snap Instagram Tick Tock please get serious the attention of the entire world is on these eight or nine platforms at scale it costs zero money to post on it this is an opportunity that has never existed in the history of mankind and we are all sitting here on our hands not doing enough the fact that not every person in this room raised their hand when I said do you post on social media every day speaks to and don't forget we're not here for a conference talking about movies this is not a conference talking about sneakers we're not here talking about the environment this is a [ __ ] business conference this is a [ __ ] business conference and you're [ __ ] sitting here and not posting on social every day [ __ ] you thank you you don't have to because you don't give a [ __ ] Mazel Tov I'm happy but if you are not posting on social because your business is good enough and you're happy please be careful I've seen this movie over and over and now I have gray hairs and kids you know what happens with gray hairs experience and you know what comes with experience you've seen this movie before I was at conferences like this 15 years ago when everyone was like I'm good I have email marketing I don't need search I was at conferences when people said I'm good with search I'm perfect I got searched I don't need YouTube YouTube's a fad Twitter's a fad Facebook's a fad tick tock's a fad I remember for some of you that are older remember this thing how many people here had a Blackberry before this phone raise your hands raise it high kids keep it high one more time keep it up kids do you know how many of these people that raised their hands said they would never get an iPhone because they needed the buttons on the [ __ ] BlackBerry humans are very good at saying no no I don't want to know AI it's bad no I don't care about Tick Tock it's for kids Brazil as I leave this stage I ask you for one thing if you sit in this audience and you say no a lot promise me one thing change that no to maybe Maybe spend five hours actually downloading and researching and trying taste it taste it do that you'll find yourself in a much bigger place than you started thank you [Applause] [Music]
i-eIWetPKjM,How To Grow Your Brand On Social Media In 2024,Unknown,189064,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i-eIWetPKjM/hq720.jpg,2023-09-25 00:00:00,2091,WRLDINVSN Network,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-eIWetPKjM,you have to understand that no matter what it looks like in this very moment for your business whether you are in the negative in your bank account right now whether you are investing every single thing that you got into reinvestment back to stock up more inventory or to do more marketing or to run more social media Facebook ads or whatever it is that no matter how dark it might seem in this moment that if you believe it so Will other people I believe that I'm in a room with a whole bunch of multi-millionaires that are going to change the world but it doesn't mean anything for me to believe that now you have to hey what's good hey I want to just drop in before we get started with this video this is going to be Jalil with north 13 Jalil has produced content with eyl and really wanted to bring them inside of our community so the video that you're about to watch is actually us inside of our Inner Circle experience we do one of these events every quarter without Inner Circle members and inside of this event we also like to bring our resources like to bring our partners and like to bring other high-level entrepreneurs so what you're about to see is very very high level very top secret we don't bring people that's not inside of our community into our Inner Circle experience but you know what we're going to do that right here because this video was so good once again let's go tune in to Jalil uh today I'm even coming to learn from you uh with the amount of information that you got just with content and working with you know all these large companies and businesses that you've been able to see and you know just get a whole different feel that we normally don't get to see on when creating content and working with these type of companies so that's what we came here for today just to talk about a chop up so well first before you even go I just want to give a huge shout out to the founders of world and vision I've been following the journey it's so crazy I was literally watching you guys um back when I was sleeping in my parents crib you know what I'm saying watching you guys Vision looking on YouTube seeing the journey watching different uh podcast episodes just all of it you know so to be able to sit here and then see I'm humbled um I don't know what you're talking about learning for me I'm hoping I could say something that uh that inspires some people to to take some action and do some things but I just want to make sure that you guys get the flowers that you deserve because you built an amazing platform it's truly impacting the culture and I appreciate the kind is that you guys have shown and the dedication and passion I'm here to continue to serve whatever way I can to help the audience all right man cool hey I got a few questions I had to write these things down because you would content guys so how to make sure it's kind of work all right so my first question is how should creators approach creating and distributing content on multiple platforms so how many of you guys have ever heard the principal story of the the tale of two rabbits anybody ever heard that story before about show hands nobody Okay cool so it's a it's a proverb an old proverb that talks about the principle of he who chases two rabbits catches neither I'm not stuck I'm just gonna let that Sizzle in your mind for a second so I'm a Storyteller so I like to tell stories so just indulge me for a second imagine you're running around you have this vision of being able to feed these two rabbits and you want to be able to make sure that they're taken care of because we're not going to kill the rabbits right we're gonna feed the rabbits on this one right and you want to feed the rabbits and you're going around you're going around then they're just all over the place so first you see this one you're like okay I'm going to lock in on Bucky if you want to call the first one Bucky and we're going to call the other one Bluey is that cool all right Bucky and Bluey so I'm chasing Bucky I'm trying to find Bucky and then but then then blue okay wait no I gotta get blue and then I'm trying to go get Bucky and I'm trying to get and now you continue to keep going after it and now what do you have at the end of the day none of them so if you continue to chase two rabbits or you chase different multiple verticals of whether it be content or even some of you guys businesses how many of you guys know that you might be guilty of being the the dunk man on the street that got the trench coat where you just pull open you got the you got the Rolex and then you got the champagne bottle and then you got a rose and they how many of y'all are guilty that just oh nobody's going to make okay it's cool just keep looking forward thank you for being honest my sister I appreciate that I appreciate that right we got to be honest so in those times and in those moments where you feel confused about how do I go about my content you have to remember that principle of he who chases two rabbits catches neither we used to hear yo you got to be on Facebook and you got to be on Instagram you got to be on YouTube and you got to be on YouTube shorts and you got to be on Instagram stories and then you got to be on all of these different platforms but what we found now in today's era is that you want to really start concentrating all your energy on mastering a specific platform now the reason why you want to think about it that way is because social media is no longer social media the way that we understand it social media is bona fide dignified straight up TV right here right now so Instagram is serving as Turner Broadcast Network Twitter is serving as CBS Tick Tock is serving as uh VH1 right whatever these different platforms that you grew up watching consuming these are networks so you want to think about your space on these networks as channels does that make sense and once you decide to go all in on one platform especially in today's world and we're going to talk about why and how you should pick these different platforms as you guys are trying to scale your content but you want to really be intentional and thoughtful about how you go about placing yourself in each of these verticals because a lot of people are making the mistake of being so spread thin and guess what many of us I don't know about you but when I started building this company in my parents basement with no money with no college education I was a year behind all of my friends and all four years of high school added 2.86 GPA no one talked to me about business funding nobody talked to me about scaling a business or I didn't even know any entrepreneurs who had made successful amounts of of income and live the life that I wanted to live you know throughout my upbringing I never saw that I had to go out and see and seek it and find it so even having these platforms that world of vision has created for you is so powerful because now the information is being brought to you instead of you even having to go search for it so in those moments nobody taught me these things so I had to go out and I had to kind of like figure it out does that make sense so we have to always remember is that as we're going to grow these verticals and as we're going about these things we have to be intentional about focusing our Direction because like I was talking about before with no funding and no education you don't have 35 50 000 to be able to go pay a media team to be all right we're focused on Twitter okay we're focused on Tick Tock okay we're focused on Instagram so everybody can stop beating themselves up because they can't compete with Alex from Ozzy and Layla hermosi and all the people that you see that you look up to are Gary vaynerchuk all these people that you look up to because you don't have that kind of a budget so what do you do when you're looking to scale your brand looking to scale your business but you don't have that kind of a budget you go all in with Sweat Equity does that make sense so you go all in on Sweat Equity find a platform that's going to be the best platform for you so can I break down a little bit about what the pla how we how we get into platforms are y'all are y'all awake there we go I don't know about you I'm here to give free information because of how these gentlemen have served me and I want to make sure I serve you the same way so like we getting to it we get into it all right all right and let's grow right I'm here to make sure I want when you're done when you go home I want every single one of you to look at your whether it's your partner whether it's your spouse whether it's your kids whether it's your cousins your nieces your nephews your daughter your son I want you to look at them in the eye with confidence because you decided to come with an investment of time and energy and you now have a plan where there is no vision people perish so you have to have a very clear and decisive plan for where it is that you're going in your life and there's nothing like when you have a vision world and vision there's nothing like when you have a vision and you can then also back it with confidence because you have a plan does that make sense so when we look at what these verticals are these different things let's talk about something like YouTube YouTube is the mecca write that down if you're taking notes YouTube is the mecca when it comes down to being able to build authentic very deep rooted community that is the place let's think about it very practical because I'm I'm not gonna lie I don't I'm not the sharpest tool in the shade I'm not the brightest bubble in the ceiling so I need things dumbed down for me anybody else like me by showing hands please right I need it all the way broken down right so here's how you want to think about content on a YouTube perspective think about the fact that someone is deciding as a subscriber right to subscribe to your life to subscribe to your content and spend 10 20 or 30 minutes because it's a more long form based platform on your specific thing that you're deciding to educate them on I'm saying yes or yes so we wanted if you're willing to give me 10 minutes of your time then now I have to make it meaningful and impactful so now I know that there's more intention and investment be it time energy and money resources to get people to engage with that because I've got a whole majority of attention for 10 minutes so that's going to be a little bit more of a time a little bit more effort and a little excuse me a little bit more money that you have to invest in that platform so that may not be immediate gratification hear what I'm saying to you that might not be immediate gratification you might have to go on the YouTube Journey for a good three or five years before you might even see something stick but if you commit to that and you're going to spend that time understanding you're building a media platform does that make sense so people who are watching that for long periods of time over and over again what's going to end up happening is that you're going to see a loyal audience who's watched you grow how many of you guys are here because you watch world and vision growing YouTube I show a hands please and now look at where you are this is the byproduct so we got to understand if we want to invest in YouTube we got to be willing to go the distance with that okay everybody say go to distance all right now let's talk about something like tick tock instant gratification instant gratification now you want to know what Tick Tock is like eating candy when you eat candy you get a nice sugar high and it feels good but then next thing you know you crash right what you have to understand about Tick Tock is that you might put out a piece of content tomorrow that hits for a million views two million views three million views and overnight you got 25 50 35 whatever it is thousand followers that come but don't think that that means that you ate wholesome food and that that's going to stick that was candy why because those people consumed 10 000 pieces of content over the course of the last two hours and you just so happen to be one thing and they were like oh that's dope follow boom next person that's not necessarily the place where you're building long-standing Community now does it mean that you can't be like a Keith Lee and build a very strong solid foundation of a community no it doesn't mean that but what did he focus on one platform he went all in on what tick tock so as he continued to build the Rapport and show up and show up and show and feed it now he was able to see something be able to grow does that make sense so you want to look at that the same exact way now can you get viewership can you get sales can you get instant gratification absolutely am I telling you not to do Tick Tock no I'm just trying to give you an educated like uh assessment of how you're going to spend your investment of time into the platform as you're looking to scale these verticals and then if you're asking me Instagram is another place that almost operates like Tick Tock because the most case use that you're going to get as far as reach viewership and and gain uh audience and traction is Thrills which also works and adjacently to to tick tock does that make sense and then also it's a place to look cool right there's a different type of a platform where it's more you know uh how you look the aesthetic of how you look all these different things right so you have to find the platform that makes the most sense for you and for your business specifically but understand the game plan to how you're going into it now let's talk about the other question that he asked me which was how do you create on on behalf of these different platforms everybody I want you to understand something if you decide to go to China tomorrow and you decide to speak English all of those people that are looking at you guess what they're going to look at you like real confused because they don't speak English or maybe they don't speak English as fluently as we do here in America what do they speak many of them Mandarin you have to give each geographical territory what it needs to be able to survive and excuse me not just survive thrive so Tick Tock is a geographical territory Instagram is a geographical territory YouTube is a geographical territory so each of those have different feelings and feelings of content and culture and dynamics of how people interact with the platform and you have to give the platform what it needs and what it wants so you need to look at some of the creators who are within your Niche find those different people and here's one of the key things that you can do adjust your algorithm to be the consumer that you want to be able to have as your uh key targeted Avatar does that make sense so here's what you want to think about who are the Target demographic that you're going after in your business think about what they look like what they talk like what they consume where they shop who they're associated with the types of content that they're consuming and adjust your algorithm as a consumer not to be the person fellas of girls shaking their behinds all day when you're on your explore page because your explore page is a representation of your mind and where your mind's at and on your for you page no here's what you want to do what you want want to do is make your algorithm look like the consumer that you're trying to Target so that that way now every single day as you're consuming content and media you're now thinking like who your customer you're seeing what they like you're seeing what they want to identify with and now you're able to understand exactly what their lifestyle is because you're consuming that the last thing I want to say on this question I want everybody here who has ever struggled with insecurity being able to not feel comfortable with themselves looking at themselves on camera your parents didn't affirm you your brother didn't affirm you your your last recent relationship your ex didn't affirm you and now you have low self-esteem issues and different things that are going on and you're not able to to feel good about what it means for you to create content I want every single one of you guys to please be a business owner and not be a personally uh personally attached to the content that you're creating because once you remove the emotion from content creation and for what content performance looks like you will start to see the shift in your business and you will start to see the shift in your content because you will start to understand this is not a bad performing video because my self-worth is is something wrong with me people don't like me people don't like how I look oh I'm unattractive oh people don't like my brand oh my logo sucks oh my logo is not as good as world and vision oh my Graphics aren't as good as world and vision oh my Graphics aren't as good as all these other brands are no people aren't attacking you they want to be able to consume the business so many of us what ends up happening is that we allow our self-esteem to be the reason why we don't create content and now our businesses never grow because we are so emotionally attached to the outcome of what's taking place instead of removing our emotion and being a business owner and being a provider and somebody that's going to go home from this event look at your people in the eye and say I got a plan it's okay we good you're doing this for your family you're doing this for your loved ones you're doing for people that that you care about the most you need to make sure that you remove the emotion so that you and your family can eat and you can leave a generational Legacy for whatever brand that you are building and whatever God's called you to do make sense all gas no brakes getting ready I'm gonna get into my next question uh because honestly we learning more about AI we call chat our best friend right now so you know with AI being on the front for it have you implemented AI into your processes in Korean content if so can you explain that and if not why 100 so we've definitely incorporate Incorporated parts of AI I do want to make sure that I make this disclaimer to everybody okay AI has been around for years right like this is not some new form of like oh now because Chad gbt went crazy overnight now we got Ai No Chad gbt was just an extension of what it is that we've already been dealing with right so don't be afraid and alarm because everybody kind of feels like oh my God ai ai what's going to happen you want to understand that AI actually is going to help to further intensify your creative capability I'm not stuck I'm letting that marinate am on for a second if you will allow yourself to start focusing on the right way and the right perspective of AI you will be able to make sure that you keep up with the forward progression of where the world is moving so instead of judging it and being afraid of it and be like Oh Lord the robot's gonna come kill us all of that right you want to start focusing your intention on okay how can I work with this because I believe and I'm a Believer so I don't hold that back I believe that God created every single one of us with dominion and with authority which means that you are supposed to subdue the Earth so you're not going to let no machine do outdo me no God made me and His Image and his likeness so I'm going to tell the machine what to do does that make sense you have rulership so understanding that about yourself now is going to set you up for a lot of success because now what you want to focus on is how do you prompt how can you create proper prompting for the AI tools and using chat gbt to do things like like we do content creation for caption writing copywriting email email writing right we're using it for uh for social media posts as far as what kind of posts should we use for this particular demographic the whole idea behind things like Chad gbt is the more specific that you can get is the more better the outcome that you're going to receive so what you have to look at and what you have to think about when it comes to your specific business is how can I get more specific one of the reasons why people don't succeed when it comes to business especially with their marketing is because they're not being specific enough you say that you want to win in business but you don't have a Clint a very concrete and clear identity of or identification of what that actually looks like so I want to win I'm ready to grind okay great I love that for you we going through that but what does success look like can you tell me can you describe it I want everybody to close their eyes really quickly indulge me for a second those who are winners are going to do this those who are not are not the winners in the room are going to close their eyes and I want you to Envision what your dream lifestyle looks like all right Envision what your dream lifestyle looks like do you have the picture of the house that you that you are ultimately looking for in your head right now yes or yes can you see it do you do you know whether it's a modern home or a traditional home do you know if it's brick front or is it is it another type of stone wall is it gray is acting you don't have to you don't have to respond it out loud but just think about it in your head right what kind of car is in the driveway what year is the car what make is the car what does the car smell like when you get inside of it what color is it how fast is the dashboard when you get out and you walk in what's the first smell that you smell as soon as you walk inside of the house what furniture do you have what paint is the ceiling is it high ceilings or is it low ceilings is it led white light or a cool light or is it warm lighting is there a pool in the background is there a large Windows floor to ceiling everybody open your eyes real quick what did we just do it we did a chat gbt prompt you thought you were envisioning your dream lifestyle no we did a Chad gbt prompt the more specific that you can be is the better that the outcome of what the AI is going to give you so when you want to start thinking and not just chat beat Chad gbt because this is not just the AI conversation the most masterful people who are going to be able to use that AI platform and tell it what to do are going to be the people who know how to be the most specific so start thinking about how to tell the AI what to do there's many different other verticals but to be very transparent with you in our business that's the main one that we're using and I'm not gatekeeping I promise you this I literally talked about this with my brother Justin on the way here I was like yo what do I tell them because I'm really only using chat gbt right now and he's like just tell them that's what you're using so I said okay cool and that's what I did it's perfect I appreciate that man hey my next question what type of content should creators focus on creating what tips would you give them and how can they push their content to go out 100 so I want everybody to understand when you're creating you want to tap into that childlike wonder my favorite book it says except that you be like a little kid that's when you're going to experience what heaven feels like on Earth so you want to approach every single day with the opportunity to create I would be very very honest with y'all if you really really want to see what it's like to live in childlike Wonder read this book it's going to be you're going to be like wait what Jalil it's a children's book but it's one of the best books I've ever read in my life and it's called Raj and the best day ever Raj and the best day ever the book talks about a young tiger like figure right and his dad and his dad is going to do what we usually do as adults where he's just going to to go be an adult for the day so he's waking up and the first thing he's doing to do is that he's got to go to the cleaners because he's got to take his take you know take the take the clothes of the cleaners whatever then after he leaves there he goes and he's gotta uh go get some mail from the post office then when he leaves there he's got to go and he's taking the bus to and from all these different places right he's going to you know get the mail then he's going to get something to eat then he's going home then he's got to go pick up the laundry again and he's just doing all these got to go to the car like you know just different different places right that he's that he's going to right throughout the day now we see it as he's just being an adult he's he's adulting right but that's not how Raj saw it Raj saw it as oh my gosh we're getting ready to go to the cleaners that's my favorite place because I get a chance to see the different colors of the yellow shirts and the red shirts and this going up and down the line and then we're going to go on the Big Red Bus and The Big Red Bus is going to take us to the to the uh to the mail office where uh now we get a chance to see all of my favorite posts uh post you know what a male people call mailmen and male woman Etc right he's given all these details here's the perspective of why that book is so valuable it's perspective it's the way that you see the world one person sees a piece of content as oh man I gotta make content today I hate making content another person looks at it like yo I get an opportunity to be able to convince some people about what my brand is and tell the story of what I get a chance to do I want to tell what that story is and I want you to get very very clear some of you guys I hear is very strong for those who are listening to me on the internet and everybody who's in this room there's so many of you guys who you're starting to give up on the vision of why you started you're starting to lose track because you're so caught up in the numbers and you're so caught up in the performance of the engagement that you're forgetting why you started your business the story of why you started this business is so important and you have to tell that to the world that's why I wear this on my chest every single day because this is everything to me nor 13th the name of my company nor 13th the way that this business started was in my Grandmom's house and her basement where me and my cousins would come up with plays shows movies and we would make the adults come after Grandma had family dinner on Sundays pay us to watch our shows and then go back out there and do whatever they was going to do watch the game or whatever they did and I wanted to take that childlike wonder and that childlike imagination and say yo what if I could create something when I get older that will always keep this Spirit of what Innovation and childlike creativity feels like and so what you want to start to understand as you're building your brand everybody say the name of your brand out loud that's how you talk about your brand what's the name of your brand you want the story of that brand to be what you translate as far as how you go about creating content so if that looks like you being a personal brand Creator and you're literally sharing the story of why you got started and how you guys started and going back to your basements or your garages or your parents cribs or wherever it's at that you went to and you want to start showing people what that looks like guess what guess what's going to end up happening you're going to get people who hear that story and be like yo bro that's dope I actually experienced something like that to myself yo I want to support you because I want everybody to write this down facts tell stories sell [Music] facts tell stories sell guess what I don't care about the fact that the shirt that you're producing or the hoodie that you're producing is a hundred percent or excuse me 75 cotton and then the other is polyester guess what I don't care about that is sweat resistant guess what else I don't care about that it was made in Pakistan or was made in an Instanbul or was made in China what I care about is the story that you tell me about what that shirt says the story about what that hoodie says and once you understand that principle that's when you start making the big bucks man hey I got I got one more question for you you dropping you know so many gems right now and like I said I want to say I appreciate you but before we get out of here my last question is you know over the time of working with different people you have seen you know beginner creators to working with people and content creators like eyl McDonald Chevrolet I want to say McDonald's McDonald's and Chevrolet I appreciate you speaking into existence we haven't done McDonald's yet okay but but I just want to make sure that's clear because I want cap I'm not I'm not a cat person you know what I'm saying but McDonald's you know I'm loving it too so what we want to do right hey McDonald's Reach Out reach out but you understand what I mean large companies large influencers what has been the difference between working with people that's just coming up and working with larger companies like that so one of the things that I want everybody to understand is I want everybody say the word excellence Excellence has to be the standard that you live by and when Excellence is your standard and when you live your life by an expectation of Excellence that's what separation from the good and the average and then the less than average there is a realm of excellent dwellers and they usually call that word greatness to be around people and work and partner with people like eyl and all of the amazing brands that you know that we've been able to partner with it is a standard of Excellence where we have now made Excellence Norm by God's grace I can stand before you and share with you guys that North 13th has documented not just black history but global history last week or the week before we were a part of the third and Best Fest we've been we produced all of the invest fests since they started since it was a concept in Rashad's mind right and um last year it goes down on hit in history as the largest global business event that has ever taken place that's world history when we all die there's going to be photographs that are our images that my my team has captured by God's grace that will live beyond all of us it will it will be eternalized every single day that we interact with these different brands we don't get a chance to slip off because guess what as much as Rashad and I may chop it up and Troy and all of the all of the people who are part of eyo in a franchise the moment that we don't produce at the high standard of Excellence guess what appreciate y'all this was great we had a great run but guess what be out Excellence is not something that you do once hear me very well everybody please listen to me Excellence is not something that you do one time Excellence is something that you do every single day of your life and you make a commitment that this is now the standard in which how you live your life every single day why because let's go back to what we said at the beginning of this there's someone that you're going to look in the eyes when you leave this event and you're going to say I have a plan we are good and you're going to feel confident because of the plan that you have Excellence has to be your standard and the difference between working with the brands like the brands that I work with and others is that other people they do not hold themselves to a high standard of Excellence how you do anything is how you do everything in life y'all so if you don't take care of yourself and you don't look presentable for yourself and you don't approach every single day with this enthusiasm and this excitement and this expectation that things are going to go my way that my brand is going to take off that there's going to be opportunity for me that I'm going to give my all to this but whatever it is that you need to tell yourself whatever you are believing for in your own personal Journey as you go throughout your life you have to have that expectation daily so that now greatness becomes your Norm and then greatness becomes your standard I sit here today with promises that I've made to both my mom my dad and my grandma which is the most important promises that I have because I don't have any kids and I don't have a wife yet or a girlfriend right the internet is watching right and and I say all of that to say that these promises mean everything my grandmom is 96 years old and I don't know how much longer she might have left she's cool right now but she could be going tomorrow I looked her in her eyes and I said Grandma I'm going to make sure that the world knows our name and all those sacrifices and those prayers that you pray in the middle of the night where you didn't know how you was going to feed seven kids those prayers were answered by God and I'm going to live those prayers out that crap makes me emotional bro so I realized that now I have to uphold a standard of Excellence your brand must be a standard of Excellence when they think of your brand when they see your logo it should be synonymously tied to Greatness and Excellence that's why when you see Nike you think just do it when you see Nike you think of Excellence you want to make sure that your brand is synonymously tied with whatever that greatness standard looks like for you the main thing that I want to leave every single one of you guys with is this if you take it seriously so so will other people if you build it they will come you have to understand that no matter what it looks like in this very moment for your business whether you are in the negative in your bank account right now whether you are investing every single thing that you got into reinvestment back to stock up more inventory or to do more marketing or to run more social media Facebook ads or whatever it is then no matter how dark it might seem in this moment that if you believe it so other people there will never be an investment that you make that the Universe does not see hard work does not go unnoticed so continue to keep committing continue to keep going continue to keep fighting for it continue to keep thriving for it continue to keep striving for it continue to keep working at it continue to keep waking up every single day with the same level of enthusiasm and the same level of passion and the same level of energy that you need to give until you see the Breakthrough that you're looking for I believe that I'm in a room with a whole bunch of multi-millionaires that are going to change the world let's go [Applause] but it doesn't mean anything for me to believe that now you have to say so that's what you know that's what I'll leave you guys that's big man and we talk about you know believing in yourself because that's all this was this was us believing in ourselves my dad's standing back down the back and like we was battling he was like man you better go to the league you invest that money I'm like nah we doing this brand but that right there and him standing back there and seeing us today he see the belief that we had and what is have become so you guys got to believe even if your parents don't see even if you your friend don't see even if your girlfriend your wife don't see you gotta believe in that and you got to go for it and you gotta make it happen all right because you never know what's gonna be on that other side all right man we appreciate you delivering hey man everybody [Music] thank you [Music]
L7mcHxcUnM4,Build Your Brand in 30 Days | Best Social Media Marketing Strategy for Entrepreneurs,Unknown,95801,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L7mcHxcUnM4/hq720.jpg,2020-03-24 00:00:00,1437,Marley Jaxx,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7mcHxcUnM4,"(bright music) - I don't know about you but when I have this
awesome business idea, I want it done yesterday. So in this video, I put together a plan for how to build your brand in 30 days. I'm gonna give you the
step-by-step, the day-by-day, every single thing you
have to accomplish each day over the next 30 days. I'm giving you the best social
media marketing practices for entrepreneurs so you can achieve this. And actually, before we get into it, I've actually broken it down, you can click the link below where I break down each day, each goal, so you can accomplish
building out your brand in the next 30 days. Let's go. I've broken this down into three phases. There's lead generation, lead
nurture, and lead conversion. So that's about 10 days for each section. Some sections might be
heavier than others, depending on where you're at in your business model currently. So the first thing, first
day, before anything, before you can build a brand and have something to sell to people, you need to know who those people are. So day one is about developing
your audience and your niche. Who are you actually serving? Who are you talking to? Who do you wanna help and
provide and serve in this world? Who are those people? And what do they want? What do they need? What keeps them up at night? What's the solution that you
provide to their problems? There's this concept called
Red Ocean Blue Ocean, and that means in the world of marketing or the world of products and services, the Red Ocean is a space
where it's quite competitive, and it's called Red Ocean because there's this imagery of sharks and really eating each
other and competing, that these waters become so bloodied. Then, there's the Blue Ocean where it's this bright Blue Ocean, it's yours for the taking. However, in that Blue Ocean,
it's so open that potentially, you might not have customers there. There's tons of customers
in the Red Ocean, but that's where the
content or the category king might be the one who is
winning in that space, and there's so many competitors
and an audience there. And the Blue Ocean is where, like I said, it might be such a new opportunity that your audience isn't there yet. It might take more capital and building before you can really establish
yourself in that space. We wanna find the
in-between, the Purple Ocean, 'cause the Red Ocean is where
it's very highly-competitive, but there's an audience there. So how can you take that niche and find a sub-niche from it, that you take what you know is popular but create something that's
a little bit of a tangent off so that you create this
whole new opportunity? And this is where your brand can excel is if you can take a new opportunity, something that people already
have but show them a new way. For example, Blockbuster. People loved Blockbuster. Going to the Blockbuster stores and be able to pick a movie,
rent it, bring it back, instead of going to the movie
theater or buying movies, but Netflix created a new opportunity where it was movies on-demand, wherever you are from any device. And unfortunately, Blockbuster and all the
other movie rental places that were in a Red Ocean
at the time are no longer. The next step in the first 10 days after you figured out who's
the audience you wanna serve is how do you wanna serve them? Let's develop your offer. This is your product or service. This is the new opportunity, the opportunity switch
that you bring to them. Like I mentioned, there was Blockbuster. They were in this very competitive niche, and Netflix created a new opportunity, total opportunity switch that instead of people
having to leave their house, get in the car, drive to Blockbuster, they could, through a
remote, pick any movie anytime that they wanna watch anywhere. And now, yes, there are
other competitors to Netflix. There's Amazon Prime, there's Hulu, there's so many that I
can't even think to name, but Netflix has this first-mover advantage and they were able to create
their name in the space first. But then for anyone
new who comes in there, now that's where it's gonna
get more competitive for them even though Netflix is the category king. So think of it this way when
you're creating your offer is how can you create something that's totally different
for your audience, something that gives you
the first-mover advantage, and is something that your audience
completely, totally wants. And the biggest way,
the best way to do this is to listen to what
does an audience want. Find a warm audience,
find out what they want, and then give it to them. And as we're creating an offer,
I want you to think ahead, not just one product or service. How can you actually
create a value ladder? And I actually have a
whole video on my channel about how we created our value ladder. And this is where you have an audience that you can ascend to them through different levels
of value and price points to be able to work with you through your products or services. Think of it like this:
someone could buy my book, which is, I don't know, 10, $20. That's an entry-level way
that they can get access to me with a low investment of time and money. Then, as they begin to
know, like, and trust me, then maybe they wanna
buy my course for $200. And then after that, they have more of a relationship with me that I've been able to provide
them value through my book, and through my course that now
they want maybe the next step which is maybe a live event. They wanna meet me in person, they wanna come attend
and be in this group, in this community, and spend more time and
learn more in-depth. So they are now willing to
invest more time and resources into a higher level of that value ladder. And after you've ascend
them through there, maybe you have a very high-ticket offer where they wanna pay
you thousands of dollars for a mentorship program or
marketing, a coaching program. See how we started from the
beginning of the value ladder all the way up to the top, and through that, we
were able to ascend them because you have built this
know, like, and trust factor, and they actually feel more comfortable, and yes, I will give you
my hard-earned money, and I will hold up my credit
card to anything you offer me because I know the value
that I'm gonna get in return. And it doesn't just have to be a book, an online course, an event. That was just an example
of my value ladder. But a value ladder can even be someone coming in for a haircut and then signing them up
for a subscription model where they come in to get
their hair done every month. It can be McDonald's saying,
do you want fries with that, that they go from just the
burger to the whole combo. There's lots of different ways that you can create a value ladder, and go check out the video on my channel that tells you all about
how we created ours. The next step within the
lead generation phase is actually building
your branding identity. And know that this whole video
is about building your brand, but building your brand is
more than just about your fonts and your colors and your logo. It's also about your messaging and how and who you offer
your products and services to. So yes, building your brand identity, this is a step that I bring
in after we've already learned who we wanna speak to and
how we wanna serve them. So when it comes to building
your brand identity, yeah, let's look at building a logo, and your fonts, and your colors, how you wanna be portrayed to the world. And just as a disclaimer, this is something that people
get really caught up in and I don't want you to. You don't have to spend
months, weeks, days, years figuring out what your
logo is gonna look like. And this is actually something that a lot of entrepreneurs get stuck in, and I feel like is because they're
battling imposter syndrome, or they're building up their own sabotage. They're self-sabotaging so
they don't do the real work that's gonna get them the biggest results. So when it comes to building your logo, your branding, your
colors, everything else, don't spend too much time on this. You can outsource this, you can hire someone to
support you with this, but also know you don't have to spend a ton of money on this. This can be something that you build on your own using Canva. Canva's one of my favorite
graphic design softwares. It comes with a ton of templates and even color palettes that
work really well together that you can use exactly what
they show you through Canva, and I also have a link that I'll put in the description below to a Canva tutorial video
that I have on my channel that will help you with building out your brand through Canva. You can also outsource
this using Fiverr or Upwork and get support for a low cost. You have your audience, you have your offer
with your value ladder, and now you have your brand identity. So now, it's time to start
building your online presence. This is probably around day five or six if you want to continue
in this 30-day sequence. And disclaimer, you do not have to do this as quick as 30 days. Some things might take
you longer than others. But after you have those
three things in place, now you can start getting online and sharing your message to the masses. Messaging is a really big part
of your brand identity too is how do you wanna speak to your audience? What's your message? How do you actually impact the world? And you can actually look at
so many influencers out there and see what is their messaging? What do they talk about? Gary Vaynerchuk, for example,
he speaks a lot about hustle, and about hard work, and about patience, and about who you need
to be as an entrepreneur to achieve what you wanna achieve. In his messaging, he's also a little bit
rough around the edges, drops some F-bombs, swears, and then there's people
like Arianna Huffington that her message is a lot about self-care as an entrepreneur. She still talks about hard work, but she comes from a different angle, and a lot of her messaging, the way that she speaks
is a lot more softer. So if you compare those two people who are big, big
influencers in this space, they have a different
way of relaying a message to the same audience so consider how you wanna
relate to your audience, how you wanna say it, how
you wanna come across, and to be consistent with that 'cause you might also
see those influencers, those entrepreneurs that you watch that they are all over the place. That one day, they're saying this, and one day, they're saying this. And sometimes, you watch them and think, whoa, what's going on? Is this a hot mess of a person? When that's the thought that's taking away from their actual message, it's hard to know, like, and trust them and buy what they're offering. So think of how you wanna
be portrayed to the world and see how other people are doing it that you can learn from. Next is also creating your strategy for how you want to reach your audience. What platforms do you wanna be on? Are you gonna be on all
social media platforms, or will you focus on a few? So this is a good thing to ask yourself, depending on your audience. Is your audience on LinkedIn? Or are they on Facebook? Or are they on Instagram? Are they on Pinterest? Are they on all of the above? Where do you need to go
to reach your audience? And you don't have to be on all platforms. If you wanna just focus on the few that you're really good at, spend your time there. Focus there. Next is, do you need a website, or do you just need some sales funnels which is the next big
part that actually moves into some of the lead
nurture and lead conversion. So I talked about how we're
breaking this into three phases, but when it comes to your
offer and your sales funnels, these are gonna work in all phases and are really important
for actually selling what it is that you have to offer. So in this part of lead generation, let's talk about creating the strategy for how you're going
to build your audience and own your audience. 'Cause here's the thing is if someone follows you
on Facebook or Instagram or even just lands on your
website, even if you post there, it doesn't mean that
everyone that follows you is going to see it. If I post something on Facebook, it's not gonna reach all
10,000 people or whatever who are following me. I have to actually send it
to them in a different way that I know is going to land. And I could post on all the
different social media platforms and hope that they see it somewhere. But if I have their email, I know that I can send them an email that it will land in their inbox, and now it's also up to me to write a good enough subject line and build the relationship enough that they wanna continue
opening that email, or else, it can easily just
go into the junk folder, or they hit delete
before they even open it and my message gets stuck. But how do I get them to
sign up for my email list and want that to build
that relationship with me in the first place? What I recommend is
building an opt-in funnel. And I'm actually gonna
give you my template for all of my opt-in funnels that we use. You can click the link
below to download that. We use ClickFunnels. ClickFunnels is my favorite software and has changed my business because of the capabilities
that it gives me to grow my audience, to give value, and then to convert them as a customer. So what this does is if you
can offer something for free, so let's say if you are
a home decor designer. Interior designer, is
that what they're called? If you're an interior designer and you wanna give your top tips for how to dress your window coverings, and that's something that
your audience really wants, so you can maybe give a PDF
or a guide or a checklist or even a video series,
something that's automated that doesn't require you to
be continuously doing this, that they can sign up,
they click the link below, and they're able to get that. They go to your landing page and the landing page tells
'em exactly what it is that you've just promised. It's like here's my top 10 design tips for your window coverings. You can come up with anything. It can even be a coupon code. It can be a live or an automated webinar. It can be a video series. There's lots of different ways that you can provide this value and then get their email
address in exchange. So they go to the page, they see all the copy that
makes them really intrigued for why they want to get this free thing, and they put in their email address. Voila, you now have their email address and they now have your freebie. The next thing you're gonna have to do is to make this automated is sign up for an email
marketing software. We use ActiveCampaign. There's other ones like
AWeber, Infusionsoft Mailchimp, whatever you wanna use. We personally love ActiveCampaign that I'll include a link for that you can get a free trial
if you wanna try it out. And this way, people, when
they sign up for that email, or they sign up for that free thing, it automatically sends it to them, 'cause if you had to
do that over and over, my goodness, that would
take up a lot of your time. And we're trying to build your brand fast so that you can keep growing and not so you get stuck in the tactical. Last step in the lead generation phase, before we moved into
the next 10 to 20 days with lead nurture is your
social media content. We wanna be building relationships. And we call it social
media for a reason, right? Because it's social. If you just wanna have
a one-way conversation, you may as well get a newspaper. But this is a relationship
so post on your social media and have a good variety of content, whether it's 80% value content where you're just building relationships, and make sure you're
responding to those comments and going back and forth,
building that report. And then, 20% of it can be promotional or can be call to action, and get them to go to another thing where they can sign up for
an offer that you have, or a course, or a lead magnet, the freebie thing that you've created. Consider what kind of
content you wanna post or do you want videos,
images, Facebook Live, Instagram Stories, all of the above. How are you going to promote
what you have to your audience and build that relationship? And consider this, before
you go right in with, hey, I have this course
and you should buy it, ask yourself how you've
built that relationship. And consider this: it's kind of like if I were to
go up to a stranger and say, hey, will you marry me? I haven't dated them yet, I haven't taken them out to dinner, I haven't met their parents. So it would be very likely
that they would say, who are you? No. So don't go right in for marriage, don't go right in for the kiss, and don't even offer anything until you've built the relationship, and that you've given them enough value that there is a level of reciprocity that when you do offer that, they go, yes, I do trust you enough to give you my email address
or to give you my credit card and say yes, I wanna work with you, or I want that next step with you. All right, now, we're 10 days in. And remember, you can do
this at your own pace, but typically, in the first 10 days, that's where you can create the audience you wanna work with, the offer you wanna give to them, figure out how you're going to build that relationship with them, what kinda freebies can you offer, how can you build this opt-in funnel on ClickFunnels or whatever
software you wanna use that they can then sign
up for your email list. And from there, because
we have their email and we have these people that we're growing relationships with and attracting more of a cold audience, warming them up to become a warm audience, and then likely, a hot audience that then they want to
buy and work with you for everything that you
offer in the future. So once we have then, now we move into the lead nurture phase where we want to continue to
nurture those relationships. And as you're nurturing, know that because you're building relationships with other people, they're gonna then be able to refer you or to speak volumes about
the offer that you have and be able to draw in more
people to work with you. So continue with your
social media content, but now let's also look
at your email marketing. So you've had these people that have signed up for your list, that they've gotten that free thing, now how do we nurture them further? Are you gonna send weekly newsletters? Maybe you create a weekly newsletter email where you're sharing your stories and what's going on with you that week, or giving them more value. Maybe you give them an
email nurturing sequence that as soon as they've
signed up for that free thing, there's a sequence every day after that where you're sharing your origin story, you're sharing your epiphanies, you're sharing everything
that created who you are today because it's very likely
that people are following you because they see you and they see hope. They see opportunity that
you're the after picture and they're the before picture, and they see, I wanna be like that. How did they get to where they are? And how can I follow in their
footsteps, learn from them, so I can become what they are too? Within day 10 to 20, this is where I also want
you building more funnels. Can you create more opt-ins, more lead generation opportunities where you can give them free things so that you have a variety of different things you can provide them. However, I don't want you blindly just creating a whole bunch of free stuff. I want you to consider how this leads in to your value ladder. Remember we talked about having something from entry-level to high-ticket that they can ascend through all levels. So if you create a book on something and you give them a free,
maybe it's an eBook, maybe it's a guide, maybe it's a checklist or a video series, can you then, after that opt-in, they get that free thing, instead of the next page
just saying, hey, thank you, congratulations, it's on its way, what you can also do is go,
hey, and since you got that, I actually have another small video
series for you that's $27, something that's a pretty low
ticket that isn't a hard way, a hard thing for them, or a big objection for them to say, hey, yeah, I'll raise my credit
card and give you that money because I see the value in
this free thing you gave me, so you've now built the
know, like, trust factor, that now they're willing to invest $27, or really, it can be
anything under about $100, depending on the value
you're gonna provide, and they're willing to
become a customer of yours. Now, before you go too far into creating all these lead
magnets and low-ticket offers, I actually want you to
focus on the higher ticket, your core offer, and your high-ticket ways that people can work with you because your business
is going to thrive more when you actually have an offer
that people want to be in, and that you can sell that, and then build out more
of these front-ends that will ascend them into there. So consider this, if you had
a course or a coaching program where people paid $1,000 to work with you, that would be a pretty
great runaway, right? It would be great revenue, you hopefully make a
good profit from that, and from that, you're
able to support yourself, your family, your business, and reinvest so that maybe you can run
Facebook ads in the future. This isn't even part of the 30-day phase, but you wanna be able to create an offer that gives you the runway so that you can reinvest and
build more into your business, whether that means you
need to hire an assistant or need to hire graphic
design or video editors or some sort of support so you're not doing it all on your own. If all you're doing is selling
these low-ticket things that are less than $100, you're gonna need a big audience to be able to fulfill that for you so that you have profit and money you're able to reinvest into growing your business. So although, yes, I want
you to have some freebies that will bring in an
audience, that's a minor thing 'cause we want to nurture our audience and convert them with our main services, our products or services
that people can buy, and then ascend into a higher ticket, but then have people that
are at the entry level that want to be in your main core offer. So now, we're moving in to day 20 to 30 which is focused on lead conversion. So to recap, lead
generation, date one to 10, we're looking at your
audience, your offer, and who you're speaking to on
which social media platforms and getting them onto your
email list through free offers. Day 10 to 20 is where
we're nurturing them more through video content, Facebook
Lives, Instagram Stories, whatever platforms you wanna focus on, and build up that audience. You're offering them your freebies, getting them onto your email list, you're nurturing them
through your origin story, sharing your epiphanies, giving them more value that makes them feel connected to you, and then figuring out what's your actual core
offer and high ticket that you wanna sell them into
so that you have more runway and you have a way that
you can serve your audience at the best and highest level to give them the results that they want. That's what they're coming
here to see you for, right? Then moving in to lead conversion is we have the offer that we
want to sell our audience into. How do we nurture them enough to then convert them into
wanting to work with us? One of the first things
is getting really clear on what your audience wants. There's a lot of value
for you as a business in hearing what your customers are saying. Example, McDonald's. They had a lot of
customers who were saying, dang, I wish that McDonald's
didn't end at 10 a.m. I don't get up at that time. So not only did they extend
breakfast till 11 a.m., they actually moved it to
being an all-day breakfast, and now they have more people who are wanting to buy those hash browns and those Sausage McMuffins
at all hours of the day, and they did that because they listened to what their audience wanted and now have a higher market share, and now, they're the ones that have the first-mover advantage 'cause now we see other stores, other restaurants that are
creating this all-day breakfast after McDonald's did. After you know what your audience wants and you've created the offer
for what you can give to them is to actually get them
through to now purchase. And is that through just sending them a link to an order form, to, hey, here's the course or the event or the product that I have to sell and here's how you buy it. You can create that through an easy sales
funnel on ClickFunnels which I'll also give you a link for if you click the link below to get that. You can download it right
into your ClickFunnels account and use exactly that, you can
send them to an order form, or maybe you wanna get
on the phone with them and have an application call, or have a strategy call with them to show them what it is that you offer. Can they get on a call with you and you build that relationship and you show them what
it is you have to offer. That's another great way
of converting your audience from just being an audience
to now being a customer is typically through an order
form, get them on the phone, or show them exactly how they can sign up. Lastly in lead conversion is
to always look at your numbers, and this is gonna be a continuous thing. And as you're going
through lead generation, lead nurture, and lead conversion, you're always gonna be
going through this cycle. You always wanna be generating leads, filling your pipeline so you
can then fulfill your pipeline after you've converted them. There's a lot of real estate
agents that get stuck in this where they're selling so many houses and then after those deals are done, they have to hustle to find new customers. Or if they had lead
generation always in place, they would just always have this flow of new customers in and out, always going. You don't wanna be in
this feast or famine. You wanna always have customers coming in. So one of the most important
things is to know your numbers. How can you know what's
working and optimize from there if you don't know your numbers? So look at your social media engagement. Look at your follower
count if it's growing. Look at your conversion
rates, your opt-in rates, your click-through rates on your funnels, on your if you're running Facebook Ads which you don't have to do
within these first 30 days, but look and see what's
working and what's not. You can also look at even your videos, if you're creating video content and just see how long are
people actually watching. Are they watching for 30
seconds and then leaving? What did I say at 30 seconds? Or did they just get bored? What can I do to make things, to make my content and
make all of my offers the most optimized for my customers so that my audience then
becomes paying customers? Don't just base it on
what you think you want, you have to listen to
what your audience wants which is the biggest theme for this is to create based on
an audience that's warm, and find out what they want, and then give them what they want. So you can follow this whole
plan for the next 30 days. You can do is over and over. It doesn't have to be just in the 30 days. Even if you have a brand
that's pretty established, a lot of these things can
continue to grow your brand, and I've outlined everything step-by-step. If you click the link below, it actually gives you more
details and resources and tools and things you can download along the way. Don't forget, I had a ton
of videos that I reference that you can check out about Canva, about building your value ladder, tons of other stuff on my
channel that you can see. And if you do have any questions, I would love for you to comment below so that I can support you
with building your brand. It can especially be tricky when it comes to what are my offers? How do I build up my value ladder? And that's something
that I really love to do and I'm really good at so comment below if

4ajmfzj9G1g,"7 Effective Marketing Strategies for 2024 (TIPS, TRICKS & TACTICS)",Unknown,907270,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4ajmfzj9G1g/hq720.jpg,2022-06-04 00:00:00,1340,Adam Erhart,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ajmfzj9G1g,"- Hey there, my friend, Adam here. Today, I wanna share with
you seven marketing secrets or marketing hacks or marketing tricks, essentially things that
nobody's really talking about. Not even me that often. And it's because they're
a little more complicated and a little more nuanced than the quick hits that we often get when it comes to social media, things like post at this time, or adapt your content
for this algorithm tweak or use this kind of font
or this kind of color or all of those things. What I'd rather do is get to
the core of why your marketing may not be working as well as you want. And even if it is working okay, understanding the seven things that I'm gonna be walking
you through here today will allow you to immediately
upgrade all of it. Get better results, more
clicks, more traffic, more sales from everything you do. And not only that, probably the most important
thing that I could ever give you is to show you how to
think about your marketing, how to process different
marketing strategies and basically the crazy stuff
that goes on inside my head when I'm evaluating different
marketing tactics and tools and resources and all of that. So my goal here today is
as ambitious as it is, is to try to pack seven
secrets and seven hacks into a very short period of time, so that you're gonna
be able to watch this. And you're going to be able to extract these little golden nuggets and
apply them to your business, to your client's business, to whatever it is that you're doing. And it starts right now. So the very first thing
that we need to talk about is kind of what ends up
happening when someone says, ""Hey, my marketing's just not working. Like, it's just nothing's happening. No one's clicking. No one's watching my stuff. The algorithm isn't pushing
it or promoting it to people. Nothing's working."" It's something that I hear all the time. I see it in the comments
below very common. 90% of the time, it's because they're just
not doing enough marketing. It's just a question of volume. It's a question of quantity,
not so much quality. So let me explain. I don't know who's to blame for this one. Maybe it's the get-rich-quick things. Maybe it's all of the
courses and the programs that promise that you can
become a millionaire in 30 days with no work or whatever it is. But for some reason, when
people think about marketing, they think that all they need
to do is make a Facebook ad or an Instagram ad or
post one video on YouTube and they'll just blow up and become the next viral sensation and everything will just
work out miraculously well, and, seriously, I wish this was the case. That'd be amazing, but it's not, right. It's like marketing is
just a business function. I'm gonna make this sound horribly boring, but it's like accounting or finance or legal aspects of a
business or HR or sales or whatever it is. They're all just different
business functions, which means that they require time. They require energy. They require money and investment in them in order to get them to work. Now, what ends up happening is most people will make
one post on social media. It won't get the traction. And then they'll swear off that platform. So they'll hop over here, try out Twitter now and
make a couple tweets. Nobody engages. So they say, ""Well, Twitter doesn't work,"" and they'll make a YouTube video. And then that won't take
off and they get frustrated and they get angry because
it's just not working when the reality is, they
probably just haven't done enough. And that's why the first concept, the first sort of hacker secret is identifying the marketing sweet spot. So in the most rudimentary
art drawing class ever, let me show you exactly what I
mean by marketing sweet spot. And you can see where you fall and where the vast majority
of businesses fall. And if you find yourself in this position, you know that the answer is
to keep on pushing through. It's not to dial back. It's not to pivot. It's not to do anything like that. It's just to keep going forward. So lemme show you what that looks like. So I want you to imagine
for a second, a bell curve, kind of like the traditional bell curve. Of course, that'll be the, there we go. We'll get some ink flowing here. So this is our bell curve,
our ugly, ugly bell curve. And it's gonna have
three different sections. Now over here on the left, this is what you're going to call the minimum effective dose. So the MED, the minimum effective dose. Essentially, what ends up happening here is until you're in this
range, nothing you do matters. It's about sort of making
that one post on social media that someone sees one
time and then that's it. And then you wonder why it's not working. It's about spending $5 on
Facebook ads or Instagram ads and not getting immediate sales and then sort of swearing off the entire online
advertising system and that, but the reality is we just haven't hit the minimum effective dose. There's not enough momentum. There's not enough touch points. There's not enough exposures
and reach and engagement with the audience that
you're trying to reach. And we're gonna talk about
that one in just a second, but this is where 90% of businesses fall as they sit around here in
this minimum effective dose kind of half committing
to different strategies, and then wondering why nothing's working and the answer here,
the solution is, again, you've got to push through,
you've got to move up here. And this is the sweet spot. This is where you're going to find sort of the saturation of your market. You're going to be hitting
the number of touch points that are required. Again, we'll talk about
that in just a second. You're going to be making sure that the people that you want to reach are actually seeing your content. You're gonna make sure that
you've essentially saturated everything that you can. Now, the reality is this
sweet spot is huge, massive, massively huge. Like when we're thinking
about your business, your market or your industry, these are huge, huge industries, billions and billions of dollars. So unless your business is doing a billion dollars a year or more, there's more that you can do. It's crazy when I hear about
someone that thinks that, ""Well, look, I'm already posting
once a day on Instagram,"" or, ""I'm already making
one YouTube video a week,"" or, ""I've got a podcast. I'm pretty much maxed out. There's nothing else I can do."" And they're sitting at around,
say a million bucks a year, and they're in, let's
use health and fitness. So if you're in, let's say the health and fitness industry, this massive multi-billion dollar industry and your business is
doing a million a year, two million a year, a hundred
grand a year, whatever it is, you haven't even scratched the surface for what you're capable of doing and for the amount of
people that you could reach. So you could go from one post
a day to five posts a day. You could make one video on YouTube a week to one video on YouTube a day. You could do two videos a day. You could start other channels. You could have other podcasts. There's so much that you can do. Now, of course, at some point, you're going to reach this third area, which is diminishing
returns, biminishing returns. There we go, D for diminishing,
diminishing returns. There's gonna be some point
where eventually more money, more effort, more time
isn't gonna pay off, but I can't even begin to tell
you of all of the businesses I've worked with over the last 10 years, the tiniest fraction falls in here. And typically it's when they're spending like a million dollars a month on ads and they simply can't get
in front of more people with their ads. So they're doing blogging, they're doing podcasting,
they're doing SEO. They're running Google
ads and Facebook ads and Instagram ads and all that. The biggest example here is if you're running some
kind of search-based PPC, pay-per-click advertising,
like a Google search ad. At the end of the day, you can't make people
search for more stuff. So you can max out. But again, you can make that broader. You can go for discovery ad platforms like Facebook and Instagram, where you can put things
in front of people that may potentially be interested. There's a lot of ways. So the reality is, let's find a bright,
happy, colorful marker. This is where we're going
for, this sweet spot here. Like everybody is down here in this sort of minimum effective dose. They haven't even scratched the
surface for what's possible. And then they're wondering
why their marketing is not working. The best piece of advice of everything that I could give you here is, really, you just have to do more. Now, of course, you need to be strategic. You need to think through it. That's what the rest of
this is going to be about, but more is your answer. So on that note, how much more? And that leads me to the
marketing rule of seven. Now, depending on your business
or market or your industry, depending on if you're selling something for low-dollar value or high-dollar value, it's kind of universally agreed that for somebody to
make a purchase decision, for someone to take action
and actually buy from you, they need around seven touch points, which means seven engagements, seven interactions with your brand. You can't simply put something
in front of them one time, expect them to buy and then call it a day. You're gonna have to do
this multiple times, seven. Now, if it's expensive,
it's gonna be seven to 14. If it's significantly cheaper, like you're selling a pack of
gum for 99 cents or something, you probably don't need
seven touch points. One should be sufficient, but that rule of seven is important because it forces you to
not give up too early. It's just like when you're looking at these statistics around sales and you realize that most conversions, most closes for sales happen
after like five rejections or five follow ups, five
emails, five extra calls. It's rarely, pretty much
never, the first time. Same thing goes with marketing. A bit of a side note here, but marketing is kind
of selling one to many, sales is one to one,
marketing, one to many. So we use the same concepts,
the same strategies, all of that with sales. But I like to think of marketing
as a little more exciting and a little more challenging even because instead of trying to convince one person at a time and
overcome their objections and their fears and their concerns, we have to do this on mass and we have to do it without
really getting much feedback from our market. So rule of seven, that's important. Now, how do we do this? Well, we do this by showing up in front of our ideal target market where they're present and active, which means that we need to be selective about what social media
platforms we're going to, about what kind of content we're creating, about where we're putting that. And we need to make sure
that it's in alignment, not only with you and your content style and what you like doing, hate doing, but also where your people are. In fact, that's the
most important element. There's no point on being on
Twitter or Pinterest or TikTok or Instagram or YouTube if
your people aren't there. So you've gotta find out where they're present and active online, and then you've got to make
it your mission to follow up and to make sure that you're
consistently showing up in front of them with value,
with content, and with offers. So that's the marketing rule of seven. Now the next point is more of
a psychological phenomenon, more of a mental hack that you can use. I've talked about this a
ton on this channel here, but it's called the mere exposure effect and what the mere exposure effect is, is a psychological phenomenon that says we, as people, as humans, we associate frequency with trust. So the more often that we
show up in front of people, the more often that they see
us, the more they know us, the more they like us and
the more that they trust us. This kind of stems back to caveman days, where if we saw something enough times and it didn't try to kill us or eat us, we assumed it was safe. Well, all of that programming, all of that evolution is
carried forward to today. So now when we see things
again and again and again, we naturally start to like things more because we're familiar with them. They're less scary and, therefore, we're
more likely to trust them. So this is why the marketing
rule of seven is so important. This is why following up is so important. This is why making sure that you've got a solid
email marketing strategy in place is paramount. It's crucial. Probably the second most important
thing I could offer here, the first one is to make sure that you get out of that
minimum effective dose zone and into the sweet spot, by doing more. The second probably most
valuable piece of advice I could give you is to make sure that you're doing some
kind of email marketing and you're doing it more than you think. So for some weird reason, there's this rule, this
gospel in the marketing world, that you should send one
marketing email a week at most, maybe one a month, 'cause you
don't wanna bother people. Garbage. It's absolute garbage. There's plenty of
businesses and industries where you could send one
email every three days, you could send one email a day. There's some businesses and companies that I've consulted for and done work with and own and have stake in that do two emails a day and it works. People don't get angry,
they don't unsubscribe. You've just got to know
who your market is. At the very least, however, I'd say that you should be
shooting for three emails a week, kind of at minimum. Otherwise, again, you're
not going to have the chance to establish yourself and to take advantage of
all of those touch points and the marketing rule of seven and the mere exposure effect. And that leads me perfectly
to the next kind of secret, which is that you really wanna
go deep rather than broad. So let me tell you what is
probably my biggest pet peeve when it comes to marketing. And that's whenever I ask somebody, ""Well, who's your target market?"" And they say, ""Everyone,"" or ""People with money,""
and that's amazing. That'd be great, but there's like eight
billion people on the planet. And I promise you, you
don't want all of them. Even if they all wanted
to do business with you, some of them are just
terrible, terrible fits for your business. So why don't we rein that in a little bit. And even if we were to say
separate men and women, well, now, we're down to like four billion or then we separate to this country. Now we're down to like a hundred million and then maybe this area,
now we're down to 30 million. I mean, still, we're gonna
wanna carve that down to a significantly lower number, someone that you're going
to be able to connect with on a deeper level. So the easiest way to do this is to take a look at
yourself and your business. Now I appreciate you
are not your customer. You know things that they don't know, you have experiences that they don't have. However, most people,
when it comes to business, they're solving a problem
that they had at some point. They're solving something
that they know about, that they care about, that they want to share
and help other people. So you probably understand a
little bit about your situation and what they're going through, and, therefore, you're more
likely to attract people similar to you. It's another kind of same reason that if you are a personal
brand or a coach or consultant or someone like that, you
tend to attract people, give or take 10 years around your age. So if you're 30, you'll
attract like 20 to 40. If you're 40, you'll attract
30 to 50, whatever it is. There's like this 20-year sliding scale, 10 years on each side that tends to work, that can balloon out a
little bit here and there. But on average, you'll
find most of your people fall in that range. Again, it's just because
you relate to them better. You know the words that they use, you grew up in the similar time, you have the same references,
all of that stuff. But the point is you want to go deep here and you wanna make better
connections with fewer people than these superficial
surface level connections with a ton of people. The big reason here is
because when you go broad, when you go after everybody, you're forced to naturally
water down your message. It becomes more vanilla,
it becomes more bland. And it has to, because
if you are being specific about someone's unique
pains and unique problems, well, it wouldn't be
appealing or interesting to, like, everybody else. So, therefore, you have to make it broad. And when you're broad, you're boring and
everybody just ignores you. And you sound like 99%
of the other businesses and marketers out there
saying the same things, like we offer higher quality and we offer better service
and all of that stuff that everybody's heard
a million times before and they're completely blind and deaf to. So the best way to solve this is to move on to our next point here, which is that you need an ICA. ICA is marketing talk for
ideal customer avatar. I'm not completely strict on this exact fictional representation of your ideal customer. And you've got to give them
a name and a hair color, and they've got to wear this kind of shoes and listen to this kind of music. I don't think that's necessary. It's helpful at times, what
I think is more important is that you get really clear
around the commonalities, the common characteristics
that your top customers, your top clients, your top
audience members have in common. And we typically divide this into three different categories. The first of which being demographic. So what's their age, their
gender, their income, their occupation, their title, all of those stereotypical
marketing things that we associate. Number two, what are
their geographic details? What city, state, province,
country, where do they live? Number three, they're
psychographic details. This is all of the head stuff. And this is where the bulk of your ICA should really be formed. So what are their values, their attitudes, their interests, their
beliefs, their organizations, their political affiliations,
their lifestyles, things that make them them. After all, we often want to group people into these broad buckets, like men or women or this age or that age. But the reality is
depending on what product or service you sell, you may
have a wide range of that. And it may be more problem based. On the other hand, you may also have multiple different ICAs, ideal customer avatars. That's cool too. I'm all right if you've got like, look, we work well with
women who are 20 to 25 and we also work well
with men who are 40 to 45, but those two different ICAs are gonna have different
pains and problems and fears and frustrations. We'll talk about that in just a second. So you can serve them both, but you need to serve them
both with different messages. You simply can't appeal to them by using the same generic,
broad, bland terminology 'cause you're just gonna
turn the other one off by talking about things that are completely irrelevant to them. So you have an ICA, but make sure that it's specific
and you can have multiple. And on that note, the
way to dive into that is with the psychographic details of their values and attitudes
and interests and beliefs. And I call that their
miracles and miseries. So let me find my pen, and
let's talk about that now. All right, so when it comes to creating your ideal customer avatar, when it comes to thinking
about your audience, your clients, your customers,
the money is, the value, the real results that you're going to get from your marketing come down to identifying their
miracles and miseries. Now there's this great
expression that I love that says customers don't
buy when they understand, they buy when they feel understood. The way to make them feel
understood is with this. So their miracles that's over here, that's all the things that
they want, their needs, their desires, their dreams, all of the things that
they wish would happen, the desired end state of
where they're trying to get. And then of course, over here,
you've got their miseries. These are their fears,
their problems, their pains, their frustrations, all of the things that they're
trying to get away from, at least in regards to your
business and to your offer. You need to identify what these are and ideally drill down into
which the most important and the most painful ones are. And then what the most
desirable end states are, because then you're going
to be able to position your business as the bridge that takes them from
miracle, oh, here we go. Memo to self: I gotta buy
some smaller tip markers, but that's it. This is your business right there. Your business's job, your offer,
your product, your service, whatever it is that you sell, it's only mission is to move them away from their current state
that they're in right now, that they don't want to be
in, whatever that pain is, and towards the desired end state. And the better that you're
able to communicate that, which is essentially the job of marketing, it's to communicate the value
of what you have to them in regards to your offer,
your product, your service. The better you're able to do that, the more likely you are to
get somebody to take action and to actually buy from
you and move them here. And this is where the conversions happen. It's right here. It's moving them away from
miseries and towards miracles. And on that note, let's
hit the next point here, which is a very cliched thing to say, but I wanna break it
down a little bit more. There's this super cliched
saying in marketing that says you want to sell
the benefits, not the features or sell the sizzle, not the steak. The problem is, is that like most cliches, there's that element of truth to it that's absolutely the fact here, is like when it comes to marketing and to representing what
it is that you're selling and what you're trying to promote, it's not about the features, it's about what those
features are going to deliver through the benefits. That's what they're after. They don't care about features. They care about how those features are going to positively impact them. So yes, we can make a cursory
mention of the features. We gotta highlight them. We'll talk about them. And we'll talk about kind
of the flip side of that in just a second, but the
real value is in the benefit. Now, one of my favorite examples and it kind of stems from
like, ""Hey, sell me this pen."" Well, it comes down to, this pen doesn't actually have a pen cap, but we're gonna use that analogy anyway. It's sort of like, well, why does the pen have a
pen cap or fictional pen cap? And the reason that this pen has a pen cap and the benefits it provides, that's what we wanna highlight. So the feature is a pen cap. The benefits is, well, it
prevents you from getting ink all over yourself. And then of course we
could elaborate on that. We could explain it a
little further and so on. A bit of a side note, do you know why pen caps have
like those tiny little holes? I dunno if you've got a pen
around, you can find one, but like they've got those
little holes on the pen lid, it's actually so if you swallow it, you don't choke to death. Random, hey. Anyway, the reason that benefits work significantly better than features, is because benefits
are emotionally driven, and emotion is far more
powerful driver than logic. It doesn't mean we can't have logic. It doesn't mean we shouldn't use logic. We absolutely should, but
emotion is the money maker. That's what compels
somebody to take action. When they feel it, like,
deep down in their core, this is going to make my life better. This is going to help me
achieve the goals that I want. This is going to increase my status. This is going to make me
healthier or happier or wealthier or any of those intrinsic
drivers that we have as humans, when we're able to
properly communicate that, that's when conversions happen. That's when sales happen. Now here's the kicker. When you're first creating your marketing, whether it's through an ad or a sales page or a social media post or an
email or anything like that, we always wanna highlight the benefits. And then of course, we're
gonna talk about the features. But if for some reason, people
don't convert, we flip it. And then the next time,
we lead with features and we back up the benefits. And the reason that we do this is because we know that emotion is a significantly more
powerful driver than logic, but logic still has a part. Not to mention, it's not
that some people are, or it's not just that some people are more emotional than logical. We all know those people that fall on one end of
the spectrum or another, but it's also that we, as people, we have days where we're more
emotional or more logical. And within those days, we have hours where we're more
emotional and more logical and there's situations and circumstances that you can't always control for, which is why we really
want to cover our bases. We wanna, of course, lead with emotion, 'cause it's the most powerful driver, but we want to back it up with logic. The next time somebody interacts with us, if we tried emotion and it didn't work, we'll lead with logic and
we'll back it up with emotion, and we'll kind of go back and forth. We'll sprinkle in social proof. We'll sprinkle in other
forms of testimonials, we'll sprinkle in guarantees
and risk reversals. We'll use all of the tools
in our toolbox as marketers to get somebody to take action, knowing full well that
we don't have control over where they're at right
now in their current situation. And it's funny, I didn't
actually plan this, but this actually kind
of leads us full circle back to that beginning statement of minimum effective dose of you're simply probably not doing enough if you're not getting the
results that you want. I mean, you can see here, when we look over the rule of seven and the mere exposure
effect, we need to go deep. We need to have ICAs, talk about their miracles and miseries. We need to highlight benefits. And if that doesn't work, we
go for the logical element. And then we go back to benefits. All of this is going to take time. It's gonna take energy, and it's gonna take
investment in your marketing, which is why if you're
at this stage right now where it's just not delivering
the results that you want, you need to do more. Now of course, I'm not
gonna leave you hanging with just that, which is why I'm gonna
link up a video right here that's gonna show you a
digital marketing strategy that's going to help. So make sure to check it out now, and we'll see you in the next video. Now the worst offense here is
not having a marketing funnel or more accurately not thinking
about your marketing funnel and instead, just hoping and wishing."
UpdUHFkh22o,Build a POWERFUL Personal Brand on Social Media in 5 Steps | Branding shoot BTS  📸,Unknown,53978,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UpdUHFkh22o/hq720.jpg,2023-08-30 00:00:00,1117,Modern Millie,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpdUHFkh22o,[Music] how can you truly create a powerful personal brand that stands out against the millions of other people online I've worked with three different branding experts over the past few years so in this video I wanted to teach you a DIY way that you can develop your own personal brand in case you don't have the budget to hire someone else to help you so to teach this I'm going to walk you through the exact process that my team and I did this past year to develop our updated branding for my new course bundle the bsp model as always time stamps are in the description below because I value your time and you already know why you're here so let's just get into it to create a strong and powerful personal brand it's probably going to be helpful to know what a personal brand is so there are a few definitions online out there like the process of defining and promoting what you stand for as an individual or the process of creating identity for yourself as an individual but the definition that we're gonna dive into because I think it explains it the the best is the one from Wikipedia so Wikipedia says scooting over personal branding is the conscious and intentional effort to create and influence public perception of an individual by positioning them as an authority in their industry elevating their credibility and differentiating themselves from the competition to ultimately Advance their career widen their circle of influence and have a larger impact so good so let's break it down a little bit because that was a mouthful to be honest personal branding this is the conscious and intentional effort to create and influence public perception of an individual let's talk about that part branding is more than just like pretty colors and what you want to be known for those are a part of it what it comes down to is your intention of what you want to be known for being in alignment with the Public's perception of you and your brand so if you could get your personal branding to communicate exactly what you want to be perceived as then we can can continue the definition you position yourself as an authority in your industry elevating your credibility and differentiating yourself from the competition obviously there's multiple ways and reasons we want to establish our personal brand but ultimately this can advance your career widen your circle of influence and have a larger impact all right so how do you actually do this I created the five-step DIY method to help you develop your personal brand in one day so the five steps that we're going to go over in this video are values Vibes visuals voice and content tried to come up with another V but I couldn't I wanted to call it like the five V's or so values Vibes and visuals this is going to be part of your creation process in developing your branding and then your voice and content is part of the implementation and the stuff that you put out to the world jumping straight into your brand values brand values are the key values that guide how you operate and make decisions as an individual or within your business well this could be a whole video itself diving into this topic basically what you're going to do is pick the three to five words that are the most important to you how do you want to run your business what do you want your brand to communicate this was the first thing I did when figuring out how I wanted to position the bsp model I set values for it the four values that I chose were professional generous simple and transparent I felt like those are the most important things for me to communicate with this new course bundle so basically the bsp model bsp is standing for build scale profit it's a course bundle for Content creators that teaches them from A to Z how to grow a business as a content creator right email list branding Instagram YouTube Tick Tock making money all the things that's what the course bundle teaches I wanted this course bundle to come across as professional as possible while being generous and giving away as much knowledge as I can for the lowest cost possible while having it be a simple clear path for Content creators to follow and of course being transparent you all know how important transparency is for me authenticity all those things so that is really what I wanted this course bundle and Community to communicate to Future students to help you narrow down your brand values I'm going to pop up here on the screen 200 value examples so you can pause this video right now pick a handful that stick out to you and then move on if after this video you're like Millie I need more brain branding info how can I take what you're teaching even further or maybe you want to dive into making logos picking your fonts anything that I didn't cover today I do have a free link below how to create a brand style guide which was created by HubSpot who's also the sponsor of this video yes this is free and it's 40 pages a 40 page brand style guide that will teach you everything that you need to know so inside of this guide there's tips for logo Styles fonts and colors for your brand you'll see examples of brand style guides from recognizable companies across the globe like Netflix and of course templates to help you get started documenting your own style guide I love partnering with HubSpot because they're always creating free resources like this for creators entrepreneurs and small businesses so download the guide below after this video for more branding tips step two let's set the Vibes for your brand this is my favorite part not gonna lie this is one of my favorite things that I did when I was creating my branding for it's Modern Millie and then I carried the same concept for my branding for the bsp model so basically you just want to ask yourself how do you want your brand to feel to other people do you want it to feel exciting and fun or warm and inviting ask yourself if my business or my personal brand was a location what would it look like is it a coffee shop is it a beach hut in Hawaii what does that location look like is it like a modern mansion home visualize it try to get the feels and then create a Pinterest board with these Vibes with its Modern Millie I always knew I wanted it to be fun and warm and very much me I gravitated towards teals and oranges and even in my Pinterest board Not only was I saving photos and pictures of visuals and locations that I liked but I also saved different textures that I liked different color combos different fonts different logos of other brands that inspired me and made me go yeah that's that's Modern Millie this is the same thing I did for the bsp model what did I want the vibe of that course bundle to be next we have visuals after you've created your Pinterest board we're going to narrow down even further and these visuals are elements like your color palette fonts logos and even your brand photos that you use across your branding your website Instagram carousels so the first step narrowing down your color palette I know I say this is my favorite part but again this is another one of my favorite Parts when it comes to branding so you're going to take your Pinterest board and you're going to turn that into a color palette there are two ways to do this first you can take a screenshot of your Pinterest board a section of your board that just screams your name and you're going to upload that to HTML Color Picker from here you can select specific colors of that screenshot and those will then become your color palette or you can pull up your Pinterest board on on one side of your computer screen and then on the other side of your computer screen go to coolers dot Co to really get specific with the colors that you want this is exactly again what I did for build scale profit so with build scale profit I knew okay profit money green I want a good green for my color palette for build I felt like build was setting a foundation the foundation made me think of like earthy dirt you know so I was like okay let's go with like a gold a brownish and then scale I just wanted like a dominant professional color that was a potentially common color in social media so like Facebook and Linkedin are very professional those are Blues so I knew those were kind of the colors that I wanted to play around with and even the Pinterest board had those similar Vibes so I used colors dot Co to get really specific and pick the colors that I ended up loving and choosing for the bsp model now for more info on fonts logos again you could download the brand guide below because we focused on colors I want to talk a little bit about photos because your photos and colors are going to be used everywhere like sales Pages emails logos the slideshows for my courses is or even very specific with brand colors and even I take it further I take it further with the content I create my YouTube videos I usually only wear my brand colors in my YouTube videos You'll see warm oranges Reds yellows neutrals white tan black and even some blues so a light blue dark Blues those are the main colors that I wear in my videos we took it a step further with the bsp model so after we chose the brand colors we knew that we wanted the sales page to be as consistent as possible with those colors so I booked an Airbnb surprisingly it was one just one city away from me it wasn't that expensive my husband and I went to the Airbnb and took photos which looked a little bit like this on our way to do the brand shoot we're so excited [Music] now we're excited now we're ready now we're ready let's do it all right we've made it to the Airbnb I want to show you the outfits that I brought how I have everything set up the shot list mood board the colors and the direction that we're going for for this shoot so as you can tell here's the first outfit I'm going to flip my mic around and show you the rest okay outfit number one green I know Green's not usually my brand color but we'll talk about that in a second for outfit number two we have just classic white turtleneck with some jeans gonna do like a high bun for that outfit three we have a more corporatey look we have these beige pants white crop that won't be inside out and this nice jacket that I got from Zara everybody and then final outfit will be just a cozy sweatsuit so here's the sweats we're gonna do messy bun this is like oh I'm just your everyday content creator type of a look let's go over here oh let's shall we do a tour of the place this is the master bedroom hi hello how are you master bedroom we have the nice bathroom in here which will not be shooting in another bedroom over here potential for shooting I like this little corner it's kind of dark oh well uh this is the front door obviously all of our gear is here so it's a little bit of mess but we'll probably shoot here and the kitchen I definitely have a vision for this setup right here another bathroom I love the kitchen but I'm not going to be shooting in the kitchen um and then coming here we're setting up the first shot or John setting up the first shot we're going to shoot on the couch for this outfit so this is the couch and of course we have the nice fireplace outside thinking doing there's a hammock over there I don't know if you could see it new thinking of shooting there so I have a new course that I launched and it's called build scale profit model these are the brand colors for the course I wanted it to be like completely different from its Modern Millie and feel a lot more professional so we have like a deep green like this forest green I absolutely love which is weird because I usually don't like greens for my brand but I just love that look uh we have these Navy blues and then kind of gold so those are the brand colors I have this little mood board going on Pinterest of some shots that I really really liked and today we're going to not only take photos we're gonna do video as well and then my content creator manager she created a shot list for me so these are extra shots that she would want for using in reels or tick tocks or b-roll other things like that so we have a full day ahead I just finished doing my nails ignore the Apple watch tan line and let's get to shooting [Music] thank you now of course the setup doesn't have to be fancy I've done a branding photo shoot with my sister we simply used our phones she had different outfits picked for her brand colors we walked around my house did different setups and that was our branding shoe before jumping into steps four and five I do want to say if you've learned something new today give this video a thumbs up so that you can help it reach other content creators like yourself who are looking for a little bit more guidance when it comes to establishing a good branding online and also if you've learned two new things today subscribe to my channel because I love teaching and this is a free way that you can support me to continue to do that now that you've created your branding steps four and five is the implementation phase with your brand voice this is a combination of a bunch of things who you are talking to what do you sound like to them what's your tone what are the words you say what are the words you don't say what emojis do you use what emojis do you not use I use a different brand voice depending on who I'm talking to so if I'm trying to sell my TMI course which is the modern influencer course for Instagram influencers I'm saying things like do you want to chase your dreams and land those dream brand collabs like let's get to it babes you know like come on gal so that's kind of like my branding for Instagram influencers let's get this course blah blah blah but my tone for the bsp model because that's more of a professional A to Z road map my tone does not sound like that I'm talking professionally to content creators who want to take their online presence as serious as possible and build it as a business so I'll say things like if you're a content creator that's ready to establish your brand online and build a sustainable presence that brings consistent income so the voice is a little bit different depending on who I'm talking to of course when you get started out you just want to pick one tone so people can get to know you as that one thing and then you're going to use that tone everywhere online in your bio in your captions if you have a website on your website and try to get as clear as possible with the phrasing that you say and the phrasings that you don't say when I hired my content creator managers and my community managers we talked about words I say words I don't say emojis I use and emoji G's I don't use so I don't say boss babes or I don't say go shine and let's shine through life I don't know there's certain phrases that we talked about not using I also like don't cuss I'll be like what the fart or like what the flip you know that's kind of my phrasing and then we talk about emojis too I gave them a guide of emojis that I use and emojis that I would never use and then of course your content this is what you're creating and putting out to the world I like to narrow this down into content pillars so the three to five sub topics that you rotate talking about online and this is really going to establish you in a specific industry and you can really establish yourself as an authority in those topics alone so when I was starting out my focus was Instagram I wanted to be the Instagram coach and so the subtopics that I'd rotate talking about was how to take photos how to pose in photos how to grow and Instagram how to increase engagement on Instagram and how to land brand collabs on Instagram that was what I was continuing to talk about and because I was consistent with all of my branding with how I showed up with colors and my voice and how I taught because I showed up consistently within my brand parameters the quicker my audience and the public started to see me in a very specific way so if you can show up consistently within your brand parameters and your audience can start perceiving you the exact way you want them to then that means your intention and the audience's perception has finally fallen into alignment so after you set up your amazing powerful brand what now what do you do next next you're going to watch this video here where I teach you the one thing that you need to do to unlock your social media growth whether it's YouTube Instagram or Tick Tock this is the video that's going to help you Skyrocket your reach so thank you so much for watching I will see you in the next one follow your joy bye bye
ozMCb0wOnMU,"5 Steps to Building a Personal Brand You Feel Good About | The Way We Work, a TED series",Unknown,220143,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ozMCb0wOnMU/hq720.jpg,2023-04-05 00:00:00,374,TED,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozMCb0wOnMU,"Whether you realize it or not,
you have a personal brand. If I looked you up on Google and didn't find anything about you
on the first page of results, that's your personal brand. If I found an out-of-date LinkedIn profile or a bunch of random social media posts, that, too, is your personal brand. [The Way We Work] People tend to think
about a personal brand as bragging, self-promotion and all about yourself. But it's actually something
much more important. It's your reputation. In other words,
it’s how people perceive you -- your friends, colleagues
or the general public -- and it's what people think about you
when they hear your name as well as what people say about you
when you're not in the room. In our connected world, every single one of us
has a personal brand, whether we like it or not. This is because whenever we engage
with people both in person and online -- that’s every interaction or everything
we post, upload or comment on -- we're creating a reputational
narrative about ourselves. Your reputation is already out there. The question is: Do you want to be the one
who’s driving and shaping this story? Or do you want chance
or algorithms to be doing it for you? I think most people would agree
that they want to take control. And what this means is we need to make
some very intentional decisions so our brand stays in our hands. Let me walk you through five key steps
to building a strong personal brand in a way that feels good. First, you need to figure out
what your goal is. Let's start by answering
a foundational question: What do you want your personal brand
to help you accomplish? Are you looking to change jobs
or transition into a new industry, and you need your brand
to reflect a new skill set? Maybe you're looking to get a promotion
at your current organization and you need everyone to know
all the amazing things that you've accomplished in your career. Or maybe you're launching a new business and you want to build your brand around the products or services
that you're offering. Whatever your goal is,
write it down and make it specific so that you're working
towards a clear outcome. Next, you'll want to get clear
on what you want to be known for. In other words, how do you want people
to describe you as a professional? Start by answering the question,
""So what do you do?"" And I'm not just talking
about your job title. Are you a teacher who focuses
on social and emotional learning? Or maybe you're a project manager who is reliable and always gets
things done on time. Or maybe you're an artist who makes beautiful ceramic pots
from natural materials. What you want to do
is dig deeper into the what, how and why behind your work so you can make it concrete
and easy to remember. Just make sure to lead with something
that doesn't cause confusion. For example, I once coached someone
who called herself a ""death midwife,"" which no one understood. But when she started introducing herself
as a grief counselor who works with families
during a time of loss, all of a sudden everyone got it. If you're stumped, think
about how you can stand out from the crowd in your industry. What are the things that make you unique? Are there specific talents and expertise
that you've acquired in your career? What do you know more about
than most people? Sit down and make a list and you might start to surprise yourself
about all the things you know. Now let's think about the audience you want to share
your personal brand with. The reality is, your personal
brand is not about you. It's about the people you want
to educate with the skills, knowledge and value you can provide. Who you decide to focus on
should be based on two things: the goal of your personal brand and the people who can best benefit
from your unique talents and skills. So spend some time thinking
about these two questions: Who can most gain
from what you have to share, and how exactly can you see
yourself helping them? Here's where it all starts
to come together. Let's pull all your answers
into a single mission statement that describes who you are, what you do, who you do it for and the transformation
you can create in people's lives. Let's take the example of the teacher. “My name is Alma,
and I’m a third-grade teacher who specializes in social
and emotional learning. I work with students
to teach them the skills for fostering empathy and compassion so they can thrive and contribute
to a more caring world."" Let's take the project manager. “My name is Jennifer, and I'm a project manager
for a sustainable fashion company. I work with teams
across different departments to plan, organize and direct
innovative marketing campaigns that engage customers
while also increasing brand loyalty."" Mission statements
are going to look wildly different depending on who you are in your career. But whatever your mission statement is, write it down and put it
somewhere prominent. You can use it to make decisions
about how you speak about yourself when you first meet someone, to the communities
you want to share it with. Let's start building
your personal brand online. There are two key personal branding assets
you should think about developing: a personal website and social media. What's so important
about a personal website is that it allows you to take full control
over your online reputation. It offers the most flexibility in sharing
your brand and value to others in a much deeper way
than a resume or a LinkedIn profile. People want to work with others
they like, know and trust, and your personal website
provides you an opportunity to share more about your
personality through photos as well as more about your
career and life story. This, in turn will differentiate you
from others in your industry. Social media is also a great way
to share your personal brand with the audience
you're looking to connect with. However, I suggest trying
not to be on every platform. Pick one that aligns with your goals as well as where your audience
spends most of its time. If you're an artist or a creative,
Instagram is a great fit. If you work in a more
corporate environment, LinkedIn is the place you want to be. When posting, focus
on being helpful to others. Share interesting articles
relevant to your industry, post ideas or opinions
that can benefit colleagues, and like or comment on posts
shared by the people you follow. The key is to always engage in a way that both reinforces your personal brand
while also bringing value to others. Look, I know this may all sound
a bit intimidating, but try to think of this branding process
as an opportunity for personal growth. It's your chance to dig deeper
into who you truly are and who you want to become. This, in turn, will provide you
the clarity you need on how you can make
your greatest impact in the world."
xwwC4tC5jF8,How to Develop a Social Media Strategy: Step-by-Step Tutorial,Unknown,93293,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xwwC4tC5jF8/hq720.jpg,2022-05-17 00:00:00,1505,Gillian Perkins,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwwC4tC5jF8,these days it is standard practice to use social media marketing if you're running a business pretty much every online business and most offline businesses as well try to use social media to get customers online however the sad truth is that especially most small businesses don't really have any sort of strategy they are just posting content randomly or trying to copy their competitors and the end result is that they don't create any real results meaning it doesn't affect their bottom line positively and that it's a massive waste of time because we all know how time-consuming social media can be my name is gillian perkins i'm an online business strategist and i specialize in digital marketing strategy i'm also the founder of startup society which is an online training program for digital entrepreneurs in this video i'm going to teach you the process that i use to develop our social media strategy every year and this is how i've created the strategy that has grown our followers on social media to at this point over a million followers which is a pretty good size audience it's also the strategy that we use inside of startup society and we guide the members through to help them develop social media strategies for their businesses now you can use this strategy for yourself to either create your own social media strategy for your own business or if you happen to be a virtual assistant or a social media manager or you want to become one of those things you could use this as a framework for creating strategy for your clients and you could work through this framework with your clients to create that strategy okay so the very first step is to just make sure that you're starting with the right mindset aside from not having a strategy when people do create a strategy there are two big mistakes that they make really often the first is that too often they focus on results or metrics that simply don't matter they don't think they're vanity metrics because they think they're measuring things like clicks or comments not just vanity metrics like impressions but the fact of the matter is that even clicks or comments they aren't what you really want most likely most likely you really want to drive more profit in your company and that's what your clients will want too if you're doing social media management for clients so first of all just make sure that you aren't making the mistake of focusing on just bigger and just trying to grow your audience bigger and just trying to get more views those things are important and they help your other metrics to be more successful because if you do have a good strategy and you are converting your followers into paying customers then having more followers of course will help but just make sure that you know where that end outcome is we'll talk more about that in just a minute but the other mistake that you need to make sure that you avoid is too often when people decide to formally create a social media strategy and no longer are we going to do this by the seat of our pants now we are going to instead think about things ahead of time and be strategic they think that that means that it needs to be a full feature social media strategy they need to have a strategy for every single platform they need to be on every single platform and maybe they even need to be using all the features on every single platform so for example if they want to use instagram as one of their platforms then they think that means they have to use instagram feed posts and instagram stories and instagram reels and maybe they need to take advantage of those instagram guides and run instagram ads as well and that's simply not the case the most solid strategic smart social media plan isn't the one that goes super broad it's the one that's very strategic wherever you are and that doesn't mean you need to be everywhere you truly can be on just one or two or three platforms and do that really well and that is going to get you much bigger results than trying to be everywhere so don't try to do a good job by trying to be everywhere instead be strategic and be thoughtful about this and choose the platforms that will really be the best fit for you and your business and your goals and where you like to show up and create content the next step for creating your social media strategy is to set goals i was just talking about how it's important that you focus on results and that your strategy is results oriented well there are so many different kinds of results you could get but you will only get the right results and the results you really want if you know what you want and that starts with knowing what your goals are so before you even start thinking about social media think about your business what are your current business goals now of course you'll want to make more money you want to do it in less time you want to do it more easily but i'm thinking more specifically than that like specifically what product do you want to sell more of and how many units of that product do you want to sell and then as you're thinking about that product you want to sell well what are your goals that relate to how you'll sell that product like do you need to attract more potential new customers or do you need to communicate with the leads you already have more effectively and what are the real like things that you need to communicate to those people in order to get them interested in buying so get really granular with this think about really specific goals and then let those business goals inform your social media goals so for example if you want to attract one-on-one clients for your virtual assistant services well you don't need a whole lot of customers in that case if you're serving these people one-on-one as a freelancer so instead you need to focus on attracting just the right people and you need to make sure that you're building real relationships with them then you have to think about how you're going to measure that so with this goal for example you might measure it by how many people are filling out your inquiry form each week and that's going to be more focused on the business side of things and your business metrics over on social media it could be how many people click to visit your intake form and then you can also measure the conversion rate there now on the other hand maybe you have an e-commerce brand and you want to sell thousands of units of a certain product every month let's say you make handmade jewelry for example and you want to sell this is your specific business goal you want to sell more of your raw crystal necklaces okay so what do you need to do in order to accomplish that goal well over on social media your goal might be to just get more impressions and this is just part of your goal you know but just to get more impressions of people actually looking at and seeing your jewelry because you might know that while impressions certainly can be just a vanity metric in your case you might find that the more people who see your jewelry the more people buy so you might be tracking impressions and you also might be then tracking the clicks over to your website and of course also the actual purchases of that specific product also just keep in mind that your strategy on social media and your budget on social media are going to be strongly influenced by both what your goal is but also by the size of your goal and on the timeline for your goal so for this i like to use the acronym ost for outcome size and timeline you need to know what the ost for your goal is so with the jewelry business for example the outcome is they want to sell more of their raw crystal necklaces the size is currently they're selling 100 units a month they want to sell 300 units a month and as far as the timeline the question is like do we want to accomplish this over the next week or two in that case we will need to have a very intense strategy and probably a significant budget as well or are you planning to accomplish this over the next six months in that case you can probably accomplish it organically and as long as your strategy is solid it doesn't need to be too frantic now the next step that i'd recommend that you do is just to assess your current results so the reason why this is important is because you are about to change a bunch of things and you will want to measure whether or not those things are working and how well they're working so that you can adjust from there and so that you can feel good about your progress or you can figure out that you need to change things a different way so you need to look at your current stats and you need to see how many followers you have on each platform and the average number of impressions and likes and clicks and all those different things for your posts and you'll want to record those metrics so that you'll be able to look back on this in the future and compare and contrast the fourth step is to determine who your target market is so part of this whole social media strategy is that you are going to be trying to find certain people to eventually sell them your product or get them on your email list or something like that and it is so much easier to find these people if you know who you are looking for so this starts with thinking about things like who are your current customers and do you want to attract more people who are just like your current customers or do you want to attract a different group of people because maybe for some reason these people aren't really the best fit like even though they buy your product they're also a hassle or they buy your product but they don't buy it in the volume that a different group of people might buy it or something like that so think about just who you want to attract then you'll want to think about more specific things like demographics and this is stuff like age and gender and where in the world they live and their income level things like that and then you'll also want to think about interests like what are your current customers into or the people who you want to attract what are they into is there specific books or movies or apps or even just like interest like hobbies and things like that that they are interested in now you might have a lot of this information about these people and you might not have a lot of it either way is fine but the more closely you can pinpoint this person the easier it will be for you to find them on social media another great thing to look at and consider is who your current followers are they might be the people you want to attract or maybe not but they can potentially give you some insights into who is interested in your content the next part of creating a social media strategy is to research your competitors now you might think of these people as competitors or not mostly i'm talking about kind of the big players in your industry the successful brands in your industry you also might have specific competitors but basically we want to use this for research purposes we want to see what's working for your competitors so that you can cut your learning curve a little bit and you can create a more solid social media strategy earlier on so first this starts with just identifying competitors you might know these off the top of your head or you might have to do a little bit of digging and then after you know who the competitors are you'll want to look and see what platforms are those competitors on and then the main thing i want you to focus on after you've figured that out is analyzing their current content how frequently are they posting what are they posting and how is their audience responding to those posts this can give you tons of good ideas and important data on what you'll want to post on your accounts once you've researched your competitors then you'll kind of want to research yourself so by this i mean if you already have a social media presence if you have been posting you'll want to assess what you have been doing and what has been working and what hasn't so you'll want to look through your recent posts from the last few months and see which ones are getting more engagement and which ones are getting clicks versus just likes or just impressions and you'll just want to see how different things are performing so that you can decide what you want to keep in your new social media strategy versus what needs to change now i would highly recommend here that you actually go in and look at these numbers and you don't just do it by your gut instinct because a lot of the time we feel like certain things are working or not working but when we actually go into the numbers and look at them we find out that our instinct was wrong personally i noticed this with my youtube videos for example sometimes i post videos and they seem to do great and then other times i post videos and they seem to not do so well and so i just remember that kind of initial impression and so later on i'll feel like oh my audience wasn't so interested in that topic but then if i go in and actually look at the numbers i'll find out that over time certain videos performed really well in search even if they didn't initially hit it out of the park with my current subscribers and so i'll discover that a topic that i thought was a flop ended up getting hundreds of thousands of views and i actually should make more videos on that topic so just make sure you actually look at the numbers when you do this step and assess your current results so now that you've done a lot of research and you've made some decisions about who you're following and all of that now it's time to actually start making some decisions the first decision you'll want to make is just what platforms do you want to be on now of course there's a lot of different things you can consider here a couple of the biggest ones i think are first of all which platforms are already working for you if you have a platform that you're already getting some traction on then you'll want to strongly consider making that one of your main platforms another thing to consider is which platform you most enjoy being on because the truth is that especially if you are a solopreneur or you have a small team and you're going to be doing a lot of this yourself you'll have to spend a lot of time on that platform in order to really turn it into a success and you will be much less inclined to do that if you choose a platform that you're not that crazy about even if technically that would be the right platform for you and then another thing you'll want to consider is strategically which one makes the most sense for you and your goals so for example if you really need to attract a ton of new customers new leads and you don't have an audience right now well you'll need to think about which platforms it will be easiest to get that exposure on and so you might think about search driven platforms like youtube and pinterest and maybe even tick-tock you also might think about running paid ads on the other hand if you need to develop relationships with your current audience and you already have a bit of a following well then you might look at a platform like instagram or twitter but you also could use a platform like youtube you also might want to make blogging and an email newsletter part of your strategy because you need to have those conversations and build those relationships with people who already know you exist so you don't need so much the new exposure you need more to have the conversations the number one thing i think you should ignore here although this is really common advice is where are your customers honestly this doesn't matter because your customers unless you have a super super niche target market they're gonna be on every platform to some extent and well yes maybe they hang out more on twitch than on youtube or more on instagram than on pinterest there will be some of them on every platform and not only that but if you go to the place where the most of them are hanging out that's also where you're going to find the most competition and so that's good because there's lots of them there but bad because competition and then on the other hand you can choose a platform where there's fewer of them but also less competition and so again that's good because there's less competition and it's okay that there's fewer of them and so honestly these things end up balancing each other out and it doesn't matter that much and what matters so much more is which platform you actually enjoy and choosing a platform that does fit your strategy so your target market your people they're everywhere but they will be doing different things on different platforms and so while yes they're on tick tock and they're also on youtube the thing is that on tick tock maybe they're just scrolling and they're just looking for entertainment and they're just trying to pass the time and they don't really develop strong trust with the people they find on tick tock but over on youtube maybe they're more serious and like more focused on education and learning and they see the people who they discover on youtube as experts now that's just an example i'm not saying that's necessarily exactly the way it is but people interact with different platforms and different content differently so you'll need to think about how that plays into your strategy when you are choosing which platforms to be on okay so we've made it all the way to step number eight and we're almost there to the end but this is where the real creative work starts happening so now for step number eight you need to generate content ideas now for some people this is the easiest funnest step like finally they're getting their hands dirty and for other people this is like the pull and teeth part so hard either way though my biggest tip is to try to come up with a lot of ideas now i know that that might sound like not so much a tip if you're like but coming up with ideas is the problem but honestly when you stretch yourself and you start just brainstorming and kind of pull back your filters and just dump your ideas onto the page then the ideas start coming faster and faster and more and more easily and there is no harder time to come up with an idea than when it is the day to post and you need to come up with something on the spot right then so by coming up with a ton of ideas early on before you're even thinking about actually creating the content or posting it that will be the very easiest time and it will again help to get the wheels turning and help to just open up your mind to all the different ideas so whichever platforms you chose i'd recommend that you just sit down with a google doc or a pad of paper and you just start brainstorming ideas and there's two parts to this one is have a big brainstorming session maybe even two or three brainstorming sessions and then secondly whenever you think of an idea make sure you write it down because this will keep those wheels turning and make sure you do this separately for each platform you might realize that you can use certain ideas on multiple platforms but they're going to look differently and honestly you will probably on some platforms have much longer larger pieces of content and then on other platforms they'll be much shorter and so you want to make sure that you're really thinking strategically about those different platforms because that is key for getting your content to perform well on each of those different platforms the next step is pretty easy although i think a lot of people make this the whole point of their social media strategy it's just to choose your posting frequency and then create a schedule so for example you might decide that you want to post on the main instagram feed once a day and you also want to post a real every other day now honestly this matters way less than a lot of people think the important things here are first of all that you decide this ahead of time so you can be consistent and also volume does matter now it's more important to create quality content than to create tons of content because you can create a million pieces of mediocre content nobody will care but if you create one piece of standout absolute stellar content that people love well they will share it and they will be really interested in working with you so quality is way more important that being said on most platforms in order to really work with the algorithm and get it to give you some exposure you do need to create a certain volume so over on instagram for example that means just that you need to be posting consistently several times a week although a lot of instagram experts do say that you want to post at least about once a day if you really want your account to grow easily and then over here on youtube most of the time you do need to post at least about once a week because if you post less than that then it just takes way too long to get traction with the algorithm now if you create super exceptional content then you might be able to define these rules but when it comes to creating a social media strategy i'd recommend that you at least meet kind of those minimum volume thresholds because it'll just make your job a lot easier the tenth and final step is absolutely key honestly you could do all those other steps and then your social media strategy could just like fall flat on its face if you don't do this last step and the reason is because you can have tons of ideas you can know when you want to post but it can be so hard to follow through and actually create the content and to get it posted on in a timely way if you don't have a system for creating that content so you need to have a system you need to have a routine and so what this looks like really is setting up some sort of project management software you might already have something like this going you might choose to just use google calendar or something but i'm talking about something like trello or asana or click up or notion something like that so that you can manage these projects of creating the content and you can have due dates the two main systems you'll want to set up is first of all a content calendar where you decide ahead of time what needs to be created and you put it on the calendar with scheduled publishing dates and second of all some sort of production workflow where you're able to move the content through a production process as you come up with the ideas and you outline the content and you take the pictures or record the videos and the content gets edited if needed and then eventually someone publishes it so this is just the easiest way to make sure that all those steps get done in a timely way also if you're creating longer more substantial pieces of content like blog posts or podcasts or youtube videos you might want to have a routine around this where for example every monday you're recording and then you edit on tuesday and wednesday and you post your video on thursday just for example having a routine like this just makes it way easier to be consistent and actually get it done without having to constantly feel like you're trying to motivate yourself to find the time to get it done okay so there you have it 10 steps for creating your own strategic social media plan now there's one last important step and this isn't a part of creating the strategy but you shouldn't skip this and it is just to constantly be listening and to be actually monitoring those metrics and to be adjusting as needed you might feel like if you get this right you won't have to do it or if you knew what you were doing you wouldn't have to do this but honestly this is what the social media pros do they don't get it right the first time they come up with a pretty good plan and then they listen and they adjust accordingly and if you want to create a great social media strategy then that's what you need to do you need to learn from your mistakes learn from what's working and adjust and this is a never-ending process your social media strategy will never be perfected because people's interests and what they're responding to is always changing and the platforms are always changing so don't feel like you did it wrong if you need to adjust keep your eyes open and always be learning from what is working if you enjoyed this
